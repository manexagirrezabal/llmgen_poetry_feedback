The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A flicker fades, and darkness claims its hold.
No longer beating, silence fills the hearts
Where love once bloomed, a story left untold.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
Yet memories dance, a vibrant, fleeting show.
In dreams we meet, where souls are truly blessed,
And whispered words transcend the earthly flow.

Though grief may linger, like a haunting tune,
And tears may fall, a cleansing, sacred rain,
Hope's gentle light will guide us through the gloom,
Until we meet again on that celestial plain.

So let us cherish every fleeting hour,
For life and death are intertwined in power.
