 > assistant: The moon, a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Hangs heavy, casting shadows long and deep.
A whisper stirs the leaves, a gentle verse
Of rustling secrets that the branches keep.
Stars like diamonds scattered on black cloth,
Twinkle softly, watching over sleep.
And silence reigns, a blanket soft as moth. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  âœ¨
