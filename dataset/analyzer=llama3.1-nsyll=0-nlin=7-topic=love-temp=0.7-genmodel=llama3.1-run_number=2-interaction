 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be contained,
A passion that forever remains.
In its depths, we find our peaceful place,
Where fears and doubts are washed away by love's sweet face.
Forever entwined, two souls as one.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you about love. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
