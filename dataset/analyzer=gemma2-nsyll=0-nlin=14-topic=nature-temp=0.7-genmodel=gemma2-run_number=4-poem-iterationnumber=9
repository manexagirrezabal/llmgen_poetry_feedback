Sunlight paints the leaves with hues of gold so bright,
A gentle breeze whispers through branches, soft and light.
Wildflowers bloom in carpets, vibrant and bold,
Butterflies flutter, stories yet untold.

Crystal streams meander, singing a tranquil tune,
Reflecting azure skies beneath the afternoon.
Ancient trees stand sentinel, their roots run deep,
Whispering wisdom secrets that time will keep.

Crimson sunsets blaze across the western sky,
As stars ignite, twinkling high and nigh.
Nature's symphony plays on with grace untold,
A masterpiece of beauty, forever to behold.
