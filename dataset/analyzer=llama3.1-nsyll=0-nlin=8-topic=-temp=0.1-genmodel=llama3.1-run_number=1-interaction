 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As trees stand tall, against the evening sky
Their leaves rustle soft, a gentle hue
In this still night, my heart is anew
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
