 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent guardian, unseen, unheard,
It weaves a web of data, every word.
Packets dance through wires, fast and free,
Connecting worlds, for you and me.
From distant lands to screens so bright,
The router guides with all its might.
A humble box, a vital role,
Keeping us connected, in body and soul. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
