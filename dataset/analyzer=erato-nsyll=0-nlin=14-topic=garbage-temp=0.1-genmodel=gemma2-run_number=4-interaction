 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.
A symphony of clanging sound,
As refuse piles upon the ground.

Forgotten wrappers, broken toys,
Lost dreams in cardboard's empty noise.
A testament to careless hands,
That leave behind these barren lands.

But hope remains, a spark so bright,
To mend our ways and set things right.
Recycle, reuse, and compost too,
For Earth deserves a brighter hue.

Let's turn the tide, reclaim the day,
And banish garbage far away. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
