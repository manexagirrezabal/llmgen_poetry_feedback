Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As trees stand tall, against the evening sky
Their leaves rustle soft, a gentle hue
In this still night, my heart is anew
