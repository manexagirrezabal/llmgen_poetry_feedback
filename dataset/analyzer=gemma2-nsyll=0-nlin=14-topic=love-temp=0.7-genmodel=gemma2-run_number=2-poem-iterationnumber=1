A whispered word, a touch so light and warm,
A spark ignites, weathering life's harsh storm.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
Finding solace in each other's embrace.

Laughter dances on the breeze, sweet and free,
Sharing dreams beneath a canopy.
Eyes that sparkle, reflecting love's pure flame,
Weaving memories, whispering each name.

Hand in hand they walk, through sunlit days,
And under starry skies, love softly plays.
A bond unyielding, steadfast and true,
A love that conquers, forever anew.

Through changing seasons, their hearts beat as one, 
Love's timeless melody has just begun.
