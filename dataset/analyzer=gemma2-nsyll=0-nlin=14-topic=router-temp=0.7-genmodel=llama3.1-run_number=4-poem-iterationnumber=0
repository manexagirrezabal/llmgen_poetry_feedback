In silicon halls, it sits with pride,
A hub of connection, far and wide.
The router's task, to guide the way,
Through wires, waves, it directs each day.

With IP addresses, it keeps its score,
Routing packets, evermore.
From modem's signal, to device's screen,
It funnels data, a digital queen.

In homes and offices, it holds its place,
A quiet guardian of internet space.
Its LED lights flicker, a steady beat,
As it manages traffic, at speed so neat.

Through firewalls, it shields from the night,
Keeping online safety, shining bright.
