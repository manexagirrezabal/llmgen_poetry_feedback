The sun dips low, a fiery ball of red,
Painting the clouds with hues that softly spread.
Long shadows stretch, as day begins to fade,
And twilight whispers secrets, gently made.

A lone bird sings its melody so sweet,
As crickets chirp, a rhythmic, gentle beat.
The air grows cool, a stillness fills the night,
Stars begin to twinkle, diamonds shining bright.

The silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Casting its glow on fields that softly sigh.
A blanket of darkness covers all below,
And peace descends, where quiet dreams can grow.
