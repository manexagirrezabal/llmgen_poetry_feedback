 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of secrets, wires entwined,
It speaks in pulses, hard to find.
Packets dance, a digital stream,
Connecting worlds, a silent dream.
From web to game, it guides the way,
Through networks vast, it holds sway.
The router hums, unseen, yet key. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
