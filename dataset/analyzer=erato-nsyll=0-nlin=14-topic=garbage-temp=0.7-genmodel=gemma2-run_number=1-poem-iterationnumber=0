A mountain grows of plastic, glass, and tin,
A monument to waste, a sorry sight.
From careless hands and thoughtless hearts within,
It gathers day by day, both dark and bright.

The paper scraps, the coffee cups so frail,
The broken toys, the remnants of a feast,
All join the throng, a mournful, silent trail
Of things discarded, never meant to last.

A blight upon our world, a toxic stew,
Where nature cries and wildlife fades away.
But hope remains, if hearts are open, true,
To mend this mess, to find a better way.

Let's turn the tide, with mindful steps and care,
And leave a legacy beyond compare.
