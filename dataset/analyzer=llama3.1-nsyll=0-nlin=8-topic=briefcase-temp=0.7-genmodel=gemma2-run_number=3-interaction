 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A rigid shell of polished brown,
It holds ambition's weighty crown.
Within its seams, dreams take their flight,
And futures gleam in morning light.
A silent witness to each stride,
Across the boardroom, side by side.
Through bustling streets and quiet halls,
The briefcase whispers hopeful calls. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
