 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
Fills our world with waste anew.

As litter mounts, without relent.
We must take care to throw with ease,
And reduce the garbage's messy squeeze.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
