 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, shadows softly fall
A whispered farewell to all that's small
The final breath, a lonely sigh
A life extinguished, as the moments die
 Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading light, a fleeting breeze
Eternal rest, in endless sleep
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or need anything else, feel free to ask.
