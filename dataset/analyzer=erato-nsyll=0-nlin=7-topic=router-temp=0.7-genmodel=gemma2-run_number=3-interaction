 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, small and neat,
Connects our world, a digital feat.
Data flows through its metal veins,
Connecting screens, easing strains.
From homes to offices, it spans,
A silent guardian, in our hands.
The router hums, a modern rhyme. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
