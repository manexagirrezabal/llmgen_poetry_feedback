 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, piled high and wide,
Plastic and paper, where dreams once reside.
Cans and bottles, a jumbled array,
Leftover lives that have met their decay.
The stench hangs heavy, a somber refrain,
Whispers of wastefulness, etched in its stain.
We are the makers, the takers, the throwers away. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
