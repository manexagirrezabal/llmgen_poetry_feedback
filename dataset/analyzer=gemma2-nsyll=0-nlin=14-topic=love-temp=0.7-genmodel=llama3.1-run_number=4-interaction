 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle flame that burns so bright
Warming hearts and lighting up the night
A feeling pure that never fades away
Bringing joy to every single day

With tender touch and loving care
Two souls become one, without a single snare
In each other's eyes, they see a home
A place where love resides, forever to roam

Through laughter and tears, through joy and strife
Their bond grows stronger with each passing life
For in the end, it's not just a feeling or sight
But a deep connection that shines like a guiding light

In love's sweet silence, they find peaceful rest
Together forever, their hearts are blessed.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
