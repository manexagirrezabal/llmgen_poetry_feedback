 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a sign of might
The briefcase, a tool for day and night
Leather bound, with locks so fine
Holding secrets, and documents divine

It's carried by leaders, with pride and care
Through meetings and deals, it's always there
A trusted companion, in boardrooms high
Where business is done, and fortunes fly

Its contents are varied, from contracts to plans
To proposals and reports, in the hands of experts' spans
It's a vessel for ideas, and negotiations too
A portable office, where work gets through

With every step, it holds its ground
A constant presence, in the business around
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create the poem about briefcases. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
