A briefcase, sturdy, worn and brown,
Holds secrets whispered, hopes profound.
From bustling streets to quiet halls,
It carries burdens, answers calls.

Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of paper dreams and stories told.
Contracts signed, ambitions soar,
And futures built behind closed doors.

A symbol of power, or just a guide?
A faithful companion, by your side.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so true,
A constant presence, guiding you.
