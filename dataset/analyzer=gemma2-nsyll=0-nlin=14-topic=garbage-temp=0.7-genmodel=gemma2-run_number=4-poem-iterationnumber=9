A plastic tide encroaches on our shore,
Where bottles dance and cans their stories pour.
Forgotten snacks in wrappers evermore,
Lie scattered remnants of what used to soar.

The stench of rot, a pungent, acrid haze,
As nature's balance teeters through the days.
Landfills grow, consuming vast estates,
A monument to waste, sealed by our fates. 

Yet even here, amidst the refuse deep,
A stubborn flower seeks its solace steep.
A fragile hope, where life refuses sleep,
To mend our ways and secrets we must keep.
