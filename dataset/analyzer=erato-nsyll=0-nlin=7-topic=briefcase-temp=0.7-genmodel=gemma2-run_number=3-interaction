 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shield, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets safe within its grasp.
From boardroom deals to coffee runs,
It journeys with the day's begun.
A silent witness, stoic friend,
Through triumphs won and bridges mend.
A briefcase waits, for stories untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you'd like to explore any other creative writing ideas. ðŸ˜Š
