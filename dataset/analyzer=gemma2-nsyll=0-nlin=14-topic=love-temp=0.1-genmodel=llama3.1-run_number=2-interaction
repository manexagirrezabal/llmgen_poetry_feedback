 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

In its pure form, it knows no bounds,
Transcending time and space, without a sound.
It's a choice we make each and every day,
To love with all our heart, in every way.

With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
Our love grows stronger, until the day is done.
Through laughter and tears, through joy and strife,
Love remains constant, a guiding light of life.

In its depths, we find our peaceful nest,
A place where love resides, and forever rests.
