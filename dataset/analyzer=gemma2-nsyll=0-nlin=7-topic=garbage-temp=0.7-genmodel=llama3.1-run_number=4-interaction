 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Discarded wrappers, crumpled and worn
Littering streets, a sad refrain is born
Plastic bags, blown by the gentle breeze
Their contents scattered, as far as the trees
The stench of rot, a noxious deadly smell
Fills the air, where once beauty dwelled
A world of waste, where love does dwell
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic, just let me know.
