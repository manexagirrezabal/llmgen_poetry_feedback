 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop chats,
It travels with its owner, step by stride.
A silent witness to triumphs and setbacks,
A constant companion, side by side.

Its clasp clicks shut, a promise kept secure,
Of plans unveiled and futures yet to be.
A symbol of ambition, ever pure,
The briefcase whispers, "Destiny for thee."

So carry on, with purpose in your stride,
And let your briefcase be your trusted guide. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
