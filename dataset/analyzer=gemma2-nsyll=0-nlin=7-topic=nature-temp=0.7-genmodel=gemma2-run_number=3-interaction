 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sun-kissed leaves in emerald sway,
Whispering secrets on the breeze's way.
A babbling brook, a silver thread,
Through fields of wildflowers, softly spread.
Clouds drift by, like cotton white,
Painting the sky with hues of light.
Nature's beauty, a timeless art.
