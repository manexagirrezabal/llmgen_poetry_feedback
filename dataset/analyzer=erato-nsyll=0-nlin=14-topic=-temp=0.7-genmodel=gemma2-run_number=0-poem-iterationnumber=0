The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
As autumn paints the world in hues so bold.
A symphony of crimson, amber bright,
Dances across hills bathed in soft sunlight.

Squirrels gather treasures, winter's chill draws near,
And geese take flight, their honking loud and clear.
The air grows crisp, a scent of wood smoke rise,
As stars begin to twinkle in the evening skies.

A lone owl hoots, a melancholic sound,
While shadows lengthen on familiar ground.
Nature's beauty, a fleeting, fragile grace,
Embraces change with an ethereal embrace.
And as the moon ascends its silver throne,
Autumn's magic lingers, softly known.
