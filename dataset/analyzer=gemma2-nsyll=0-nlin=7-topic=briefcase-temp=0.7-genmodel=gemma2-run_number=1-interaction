 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a sturdy frame,
Holds secrets whispered, hopes aflame.
Within its depths, ambition sleeps,
Until the day its contents leap
To shape a world, to make or break,
A silent promise, for your sake.
The briefcase waits, a loyal guide. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it.  ğŸ˜Š
