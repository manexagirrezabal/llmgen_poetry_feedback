 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Soft whispers in the dead of night
A gentle touch that sets our souls alight
Love's flame burns bright and true
Melting fears, it shines through
In its warmth, we find our peace
With every beat, our hearts release
Forever entwined, love will never cease
