A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
A bond unbreakable, forever heard.

Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's constant presence conquers all.
A silent glance, a knowing smile,
A love that lasts for just a while.

Or maybe years, or lifetimes long,
A melody played, a timeless song.
In every beat, in every breath,
Love whispers secrets, life and death. 
And though it fades, its echo stays,
A memory warm, in love's soft haze.
