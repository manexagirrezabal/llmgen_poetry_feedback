 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks shrouded in a misty light.
In nature's beauty, I find my peace tonight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
