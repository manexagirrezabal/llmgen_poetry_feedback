A whispered word, a tender touch so light,
Love's gentle flame, ignites our hearts with might.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's sweet dance, we find our happy place.

Through fields of gold and skies of endless blue,
Love's guiding star, forever shines anew.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths unknown,
Sharing laughter, building dreams we've sown.

With every glance, a spark ignites so true,
A love that burns with passion, strong and new.
No distance vast, no time can ever tear,
This bond we share, beyond all compare.
Two hearts united, forever meant to be.
