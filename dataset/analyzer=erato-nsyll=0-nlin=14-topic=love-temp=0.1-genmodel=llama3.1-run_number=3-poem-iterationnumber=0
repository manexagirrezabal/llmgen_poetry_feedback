Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
Together we stand, beneath the golden sun.

Love is a journey through life's joys and strife,
Through laughter and tears, it cuts like a knife.
But in its depths, we find a peaceful place,
Where love resides, and time stands still in space.

In love's pure light, our hearts are made anew,
And forever entwined, our love shines true.
