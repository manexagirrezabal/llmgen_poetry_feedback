A golden sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
Upon the hills, where shadows gently twist.
The sky ablaze with hues of red and gold,
As twilight's tale begins to be unrolled.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of earth, a tranquil scene.
Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Their silent dance, beneath the silver moon.

The crickets chirp their lullaby so sweet,
While owls take flight, on silent, feathered feet.
The world is hushed, in slumber deep and sound,
As peace descends, on hallowed ground.
