 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wildflowers with glee.
The forest floor, a carpet soft and deep,
A haven for creatures to rest and keep.
Nature's beauty, a treasure to behold.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
