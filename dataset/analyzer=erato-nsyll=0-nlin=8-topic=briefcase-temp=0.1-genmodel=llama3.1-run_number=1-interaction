 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy case in hand
Carrying secrets, plans to stand
Documents and dreams, all confined
Within its leather, carefully aligned

The weight of responsibility it bears
As meetings and deals are made with care
Its contents a mystery, yet to be told
A briefcase's power, stories unfold
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
