 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In digital halls, it stands so tall,
A box of wires, connecting all.
It routes the signals with careful might,
And keeps our networks running through the night.

Its lights blink steady, a reassuring glow,
As it directs traffic, and makes connections grow.
With each new device, its workload increases too,
But still it performs, keeping our internet anew.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers to your liking. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
