 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Within it secrets tightly grasp.
Deals struck, dreams pursued with might,
A silent witness through day and night.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
It carries burdens, hopes, and stakes.
A symbol of ambition's stride. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
