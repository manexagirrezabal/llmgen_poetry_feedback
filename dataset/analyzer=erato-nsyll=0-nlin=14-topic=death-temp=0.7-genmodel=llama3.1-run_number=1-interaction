 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death comes to claim us all one day
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As mortal bonds are torn apart and dry

The wind it howls like a mournful cry
As darkness claims the light in the sky
The stars grow dim, the moon does fade
And death's dark presence is not delayed

With icy grip, it takes its toll
And leaves us cold, with hearts grown old
Our stories told, our legends lost
In silence deep, where none may boast

Yet even death cannot hold its sway
For in our memories, we live on day by day
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
