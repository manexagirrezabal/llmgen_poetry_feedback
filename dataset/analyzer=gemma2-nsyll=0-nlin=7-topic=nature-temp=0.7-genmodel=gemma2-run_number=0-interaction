 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight paints the leaves with gold,
Whispering winds through branches bold.
A babbling brook, a crystal song,
Where wildflowers dance, vibrant and strong.
Clouds drift by, like cotton dreams,
Nature's canvas, it softly gleams.
Peace descends, in tranquil light.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š 

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.  ğŸŒ»
