 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Lies trash that we would rather hide.
From banana peels to plastic's might,
It clutters up our world in sight.
The smell of rot and decay does rise,
A constant reminder of our compromise.
We bury it beneath, with a guilty sigh.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic, feel free to ask!
