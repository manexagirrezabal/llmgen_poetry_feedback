The willow weeps by the river's flow,
Its branches trailing, soft and low.
A gentle breeze stirs its leaves of green,
Whispering secrets, seldom seen.

Sunlight filters through the canopy above,
Creating patterns on the ground with love.
Dragonflies dance, their wings a blur,
As fish leap silver, in waters clear.

The willow stands, a silent sentinel,
Watching life unfold, its story to tell.
A place of peace, where worries cease,
And nature's beauty brings sweet release.
