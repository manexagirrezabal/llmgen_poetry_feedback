 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon the velvet cloak of night so deep.
Stars like diamonds scattered, crystal clear,
Whisper secrets that the darkness keep.
A lone owl hoots, a mournful sound,
As shadows dance and silent breezes sweep,
And dreams take flight on wings unbound. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked it. ğŸ˜Š
