A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
It weaves a web where data secrets keep.
From phone to screen, a silent symphony,
The router guides, for you and me.

Through tangled wires, signals take their flight,
Connecting lives both day and darkest night.
A digital bridge, unseen yet ever near,
The world unfolds, with every byte held dear.
