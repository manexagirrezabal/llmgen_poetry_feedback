 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A humble shell of leather, worn and brown,
A silent witness to each day's renown.
It holds ambition, dreams within its core,
And secrets whispered, known but to explore.

With clasps that click, a promise it conveys,
To navigate the labyrinthine maze.
Of meetings, deadlines, charts and graphs untold,
Where stories rise and destinies unfold.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop's embrace,
It carries burdens with unwavering grace.
A symbol of success, or maybe just,
The weight of duty, never quite a bust.

So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
Whose journey's end, like life, will have no bend. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
