Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a whispered secret, a gentle sigh,
A tender touch that catches the eye.

It's a dance of steps, a rhythm true,
A symphony of emotions shining through.
It's a bond between two souls so fine,
A connection that makes the heart entwine.

Love is a gift that's precious and rare,
A treasure to cherish, beyond compare.
It's a feeling that grows with each passing day,
A love that strengthens, come what may.

And when it's lost, it leaves a hollow space,
But even then, its memory remains in place.
