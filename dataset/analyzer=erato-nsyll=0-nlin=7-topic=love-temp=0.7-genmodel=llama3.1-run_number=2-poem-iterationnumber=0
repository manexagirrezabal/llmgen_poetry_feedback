Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and guiding through the night.
It's a gentle breeze on a summer's day,
A whispered promise that never fades away.
In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
Leaving room for trust, hope, and a heart full of pride.
Forever bound by love's unbreakable tie.
