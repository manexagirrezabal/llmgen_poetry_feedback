In digital halls, it stands so tall,
A box of wires, connecting all.
It routes the signals with careful might,
And keeps our networks running through the night.

Its lights blink steady, a reassuring glow,
As it directs traffic, and makes connections grow.
With each new device, its workload increases too,
But still it performs, keeping our internet anew.
