A whisper soft, a touch so light,
Love's flame ignites, a beacon bright.
Two souls entwined, a gentle sway,
In every glance, a brighter day.

A symphony of hearts that beat,
In unison, a rhythm sweet.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's constant presence conquers all.

A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust,
Forever bound, in love we must.
With open arms, we welcome fate,
For love's embrace, we celebrate.


A journey shared, a path unknown,
In love's sweet haven, we call our home.
