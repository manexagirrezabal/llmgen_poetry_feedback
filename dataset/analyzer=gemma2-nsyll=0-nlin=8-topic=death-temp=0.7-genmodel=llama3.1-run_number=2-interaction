 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death waits in silence, night by day
A whispered promise, cold and grey
A final breath, that fades away

The heart beats slow, the soul now free
A journey ends, for eternity
 Memories remain, of life's brief spark
A fleeting dream, that left its mark
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create a poem about death. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
