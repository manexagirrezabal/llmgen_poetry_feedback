Sunbeams pierce the forest canopy's embrace,
Painting dappled patterns on the mossy floor.
Birdsong fills the air, a sweet and gentle grace,
As nature wakes to greet a day of yore.

A babbling brook murmurs secrets in its flow,
While butterflies dance on wings of painted hues.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant shades aglow,
And squirrels scamper through the ancient boughs' reviews.

Goldenrod and aster paint the meadow bright,
Where crickets chirp their evening serenade.
In nature's symphony, day melts into night,
A tapestry of wonder, serenely laid.
