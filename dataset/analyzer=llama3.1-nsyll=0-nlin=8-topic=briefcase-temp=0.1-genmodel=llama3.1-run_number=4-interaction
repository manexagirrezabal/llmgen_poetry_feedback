 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy case in hand
Holds the tools of a busy man
Papers and pens, a weighty load
As he rushes to his daily road

The leather creaks with every stride
A symbol of success inside
A briefcase full of dreams and might
Guiding him through day and night
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
