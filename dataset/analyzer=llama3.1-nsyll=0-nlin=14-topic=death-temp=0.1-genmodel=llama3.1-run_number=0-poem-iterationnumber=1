In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered breath, a final sigh
The heart beats slow, and then goodbye

The light that once shone bright and bold
Fades to darkness, cold as old
 Memories linger, bittersweet
Of life's brief flame, now extinguished neat

In death's stillness, all is calm
Yet in the silence, grief does form
A hollow ache, a heart of stone
For what has been, can never be known

The end of life, a mystery profound
Where love and loss are forever bound
