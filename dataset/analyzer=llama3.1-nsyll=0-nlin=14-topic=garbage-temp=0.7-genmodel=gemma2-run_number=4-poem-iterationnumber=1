A symphony of refuse, a plastic sea,
Containers and wrappers, a tangled decree.
Once vibrant colors, now faded and gray,
Whispering tales of a consumer's sway.

Banana peels brown, coffee grounds seep,
Forgotten dreams drowned in this garbage heap.
Broken toys scattered, a child's laughter gone,
A graveyard of treasures, where nothing is known.

The scent of decay hangs heavy and low,
A silent indictment, for what we bestow.
Mountains of trash, a blight on the land,
Will future generations inherit this stand?

We must break free from this consuming tide,
And learn to cherish what's truly inside.
