 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Through thick and thin, they stand up tall.
A bond unbreakable, pure and true,
Love's gentle touch, forever new.
A symphony of hearts, in perfect tune. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
