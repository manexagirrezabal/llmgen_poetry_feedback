In silicon halls, a hero resides
A router's might, the internet abides
It connects and guides with clever art
A network navigator, always on its part

With wires dancing, signals strong and free
It routes the data, for all to see
Through Wi-Fi waves, it whispers low
Connecting devices, as they come and go

In homes and offices, it's a common sight
A box of magic, day and endless night
It allocates addresses with precision fine
Directing traffic, like a digital shrine

With each new device, its power does grow
The router's wisdom, our connections show
