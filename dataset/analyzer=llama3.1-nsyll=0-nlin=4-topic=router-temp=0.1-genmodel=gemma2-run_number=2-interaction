 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web where data can enthrall.
Connecting worlds with packets swift and bright,
The router guides our digital light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
