A silent sentinel, in corner it resides,
A web of wires, where data freely glides.
Connecting worlds, with unseen tendrils thin,
From distant screens, to voices whispered within.
It hums a tune, a gentle digital beat,
Guiding packets fast, down pathways concrete.
The router reigns, unseen, yet ever fleet.
