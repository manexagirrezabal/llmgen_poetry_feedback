The river flows, a silver ribbon bright,
Reflecting sunlight, dancing in the light.
Willow branches weep, their leaves cascade,
A gentle murmur, secrets gently made.

Dragonflies skim, on wings of emerald sheen,
While fish leap high, a shimmering scene.
Birdsong fills the air, a sweet refrain,
As nature's symphony plays once again.

The scent of wildflowers, carried on the breeze,
A tapestry of colors, whispering with ease.
Tranquility surrounds, a peaceful embrace,
By the river's edge, where time and worries erase.
