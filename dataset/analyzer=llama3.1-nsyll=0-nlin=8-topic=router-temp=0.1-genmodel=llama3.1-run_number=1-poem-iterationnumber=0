In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
A behind-the-scenes hero, always on my mind

With Wi-Fi waves, it dances in air
Connecting devices, without a single care
Its humming noise, a gentle, steady beat
Keeping me online, where information meets
