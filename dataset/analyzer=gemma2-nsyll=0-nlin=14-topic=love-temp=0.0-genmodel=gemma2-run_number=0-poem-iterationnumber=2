A whispered word, a glance across the room,
Two souls collide, dispelling all the gloom.
A silent spark that sets the heart aflame,
And in their eyes, a love begins to claim.

A gentle touch, a hand that seeks to hold,
A symphony of feelings, soft and bold.
Through stories shared, their bond will unfold,
Two hearts entwined, a tale yet to be told.

With every sunrise, love's embrace grows strong,
No distance vast can ever tear them long.
In each other's arms, they find their art,
A beacon bright, forever set apart.
