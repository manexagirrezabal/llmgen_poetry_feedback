In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food that's edible, clothes that's fine,
All tossed aside, a shameful crime.

In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
A toxic mess, a blight on sight.
The air is thick with fumes so bad,
A stench that clings, like a nagging sad.

We must change our ways, it's time to see,
Reduce the waste, for you and me.
