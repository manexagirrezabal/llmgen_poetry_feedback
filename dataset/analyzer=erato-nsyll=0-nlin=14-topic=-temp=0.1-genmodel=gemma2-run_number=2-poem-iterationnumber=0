The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustle, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where wildflowers grow.

A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
A mournful tune that echoes in the air.
Autumn's embrace, a bittersweet retreat,
As summer's warmth begins to disappear.

The scent of fallen leaves, crisp and dry,
A reminder that time marches ever on.
Beneath a sky where clouds drift slowly by,
Nature slumbers, till the winter dawn.

But in this stillness, beauty can be found,
A quiet grace upon the hallowed ground.
