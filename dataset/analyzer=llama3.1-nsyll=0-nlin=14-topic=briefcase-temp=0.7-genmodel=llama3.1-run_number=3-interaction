 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather-bound and worn with care
Holding secrets, documents to share

It's carried by executives, by lawyers too
By those who need to make deals anew
A shield from prying eyes it claims to be
But sometimes rumors leak out to see

Inside its depths, contracts are signed and sealed
Proposals are made, agreements revealed
The weight of business decisions it holds tight
As people navigate through the corporate light

It's a vessel for ideas, a holder of fate
A briefcase that contains the world outside its gate
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
