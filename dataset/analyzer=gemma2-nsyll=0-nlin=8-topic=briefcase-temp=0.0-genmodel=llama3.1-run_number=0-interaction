 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy case in hand I hold
My daily companion, never to grow old
With papers and pens, it's always by my side
A symbol of work, where duties reside

Its leather worn smooth, a testament to time
The weight of responsibility, it does entwine
In meetings and deals, it's often on display
A trusted ally, in the world of business each day
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
