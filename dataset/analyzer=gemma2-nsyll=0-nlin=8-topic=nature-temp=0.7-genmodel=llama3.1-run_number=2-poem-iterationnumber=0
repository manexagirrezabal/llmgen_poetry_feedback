The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Their gentle sway in morning light.

The river flows with waters deep,
Reflecting beauty that my soul can keep.
The mountains rise with peaks so high,
In nature's grandeur, I feel alive.
