 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come forth to stay
A whispered summons, cold and grey
To leave behind life's warmth and day

The final breath, a fading sigh
As mortal bonds are torn apart to die
 Memories linger, bittersweet and bright
Echoes of love, in endless night

The silence falls, like autumn rain
And in its stillness, death reigns supreme again
No regrets remain, only what's been done
A chapter closed, the story's finished one by one

In death's dark veil, all fears are lost
And what remains is peaceful, forever crossed.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to generate another poem on a different topic, feel free to ask!
