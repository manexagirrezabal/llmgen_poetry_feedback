 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles drift and hide.
A mountain grows, a stinking mound,
Of what we've used, then cast around.

Forgotten wrappers, broken toys,
The remnants of our fleeting joys.
A silent scream, a choked-up plea,
From Earth beneath this misery.

We fill the bins, we sort and strive,
But still the waste continues to thrive.
Can we reclaim what's lost and gone?
Or will this burden drag us on?

A choice we face, a path to tread,
To leave behind a world un-dead.
