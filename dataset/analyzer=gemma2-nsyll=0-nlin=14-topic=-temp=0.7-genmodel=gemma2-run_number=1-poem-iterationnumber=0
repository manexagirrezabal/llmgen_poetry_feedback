The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds in hues of pink and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to the sky,
As shadows lengthen, stories yet untold.

The world slows down, a peaceful lullaby,
And weary hearts find solace in the fold
Of twilight's embrace, where dreams take flight and fly,
Leaving behind the day's anxieties of old.

Stars begin to twinkle, diamonds bright,
Scattered across a canvas dark and vast.
The moon ascends, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls with its celestial cast.

Sleep descends, a soft and welcome guest,
And weary bodies find their peaceful rest.
