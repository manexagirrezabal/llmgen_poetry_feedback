 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
With gentle touch and whispered word,
A bond is forged, forever heard.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's steady hand encompasses all.
A sanctuary built on trust and care,
A beacon bright, beyond compare. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to see another poem about a different topic!
