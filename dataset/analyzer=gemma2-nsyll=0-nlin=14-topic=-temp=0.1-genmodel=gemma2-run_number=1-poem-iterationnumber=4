The twilight sky, a canvas painted gold,
Where crimson clouds and amber hues unfold.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
As nature sighs, a peaceful, tranquil scene.

The sun descends, a fiery ball of light,
Casting long shadows, stretching into night.
Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Their silent dance, beneath the silver moon.

A symphony of crickets fills the air,
A lullaby that soothes beyond compare.
The world is hushed, in slumber deep and sound,
As peace descends, on hallowed ground.
