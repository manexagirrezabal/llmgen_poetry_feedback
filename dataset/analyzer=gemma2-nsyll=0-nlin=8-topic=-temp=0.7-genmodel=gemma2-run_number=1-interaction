 > assistant: The moon a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Stars like scattered diamonds, cold and bright.
A whispering wind through branches does disperse
A symphony of rustles, soft delight.
The owl awakes, its lonely call takes flight,
Across the meadow, shadows dance and sway.
And silence reigns, a blanket pure and white,
Until the dawn breaks, chasing night away. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to see another one! ğŸŒ»
