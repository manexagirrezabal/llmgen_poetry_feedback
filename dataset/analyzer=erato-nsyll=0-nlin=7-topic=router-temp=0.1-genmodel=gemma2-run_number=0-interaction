 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with digital sheen.
Packets dance through wires, swift and bright,
Guiding data through day and night.
From web to game, a constant flow,
The router's hum, a steady glow.
Our online lives, it helps us weave. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
