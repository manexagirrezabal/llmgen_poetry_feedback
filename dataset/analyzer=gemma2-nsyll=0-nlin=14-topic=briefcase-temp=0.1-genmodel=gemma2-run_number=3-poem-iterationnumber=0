A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop chats,
It's a silent witness to life's hurried pace.
Its clasps secure the hopes and anxious fats,
Of deals made swift, or time's relentless chase.

A symbol of success, a tool for trade,
A constant companion on the daily quest.
The briefcase stands, its purpose unafraid,
To carry burdens, put ambitions to the test.

So open wide, and let your journey start,
With every page turned, a brand new work of art.
