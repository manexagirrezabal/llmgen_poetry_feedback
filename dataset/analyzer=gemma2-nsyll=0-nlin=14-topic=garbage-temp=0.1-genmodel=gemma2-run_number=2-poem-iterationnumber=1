A plastic tide, a metal sea,
Where dreams are buried, hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, carelessly free,
Whispering tales of yesterday.

Glass shards glitter, sharp and cold,
Paper ghosts dance in the wind's embrace.
Metal cans, stories untold,
Lost in this refuse-filled space.

A landfill's heart, a festering wound,
Where nature weeps and creatures flee.
A testament to what we have found,
And lost along the way, you see.

Let us mend our ways, with mindful hand,
To heal this earth, reclaim our land.
