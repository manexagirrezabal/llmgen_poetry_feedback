The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wild and carefree.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks touched by the golden light.
The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
In nature's beauty, my soul finds sleep.
