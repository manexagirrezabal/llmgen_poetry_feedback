A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting us all.
Through wires and waves, it sends data's flight,
A web of information, day and night.
From distant servers to screens in our hand,
It bridges the gap, a digital strand.
Invisible guardian, keeping us near,
The router whispers, "Let knowledge appear."
