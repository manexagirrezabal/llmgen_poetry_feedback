A whispered word, a touch so light and true,
Ignites a spark, a love forever new.
Two hearts entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's embrace, we find our destined place.

Through laughter bright and shadows soft and deep,
Love's guiding hand, our secrets it will keep.
A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust so strong,
Forever bound, where we truly belong.

With every glance, a story starts to unfold,
Two souls united, as destinies are told.
In love's sweet haven, hearts find solace and rest,
A timeless journey, forever truly blessed.
