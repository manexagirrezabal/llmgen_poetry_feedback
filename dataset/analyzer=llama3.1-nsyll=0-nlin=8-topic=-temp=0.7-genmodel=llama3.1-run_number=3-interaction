 > assistant: Moonlit nights and whispered sighs
Shadows dance upon the skies
A midnight breeze that whispers low
Of secrets kept, and stories told in tow

The stars above, a twinkling sea
Reflecting dreams that are yet to be
In this still hour, I find my peace
And let my worries gently release
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad you enjoyed the poem. If you want more poetry or have any specific requests (e.g. a certain theme or style), feel free to ask!
