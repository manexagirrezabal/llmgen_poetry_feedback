The final curtain falls, a hush descends,
A silent breath, the journey at an end.
No more the laughter, tears, or fleeting joys,
Just empty echoes where life once deployed.

But is it truly darkness, cold and stark?
Or just a veil that hides a distant spark?
Perhaps a slumber, deep and undisturbed,
Where memories bloom, forever unblurred.

A whispered promise on the wind's soft sigh,
That love transcends, beyond the earthly sky.
So fear not death, its chilling, final call,
For in its embrace, we rise above it all.
And find a peace that knows no bounds or end.
