The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets as the breeze imbues
Each branch with gentle motion, light and fair.

A babbling brook, a silver ribbon bright,
Reflects the fading day in mirrored sheen,
While fireflies ignite their tiny light,
And crickets chirp a lullaby serene.

The scent of pine and damp earth fills the night,
As stars begin to pierce the velvet sky,
A tapestry of wonder, pure delight,
Where nature's magic whispers passing by.

In silent awe, we stand and contemplate,
This beauty born from life's eternal gate.
