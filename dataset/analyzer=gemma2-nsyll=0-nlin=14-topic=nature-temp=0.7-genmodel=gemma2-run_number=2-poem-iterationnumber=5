Dewdrops cling to blades of emerald green,
As sunlight paints the meadow gold and bright.
A gentle breeze caresses fields unseen,
And whispers secrets through the morning light.

Birdsong fills the air with melodies sweet,
While butterflies on painted wings take flight.
A babbling brook murmurs a tranquil beat,
Reflecting clouds that drift across the sky so white.

Wildflowers bloom in hues of every shade,
A symphony of colors, rich and bold.
In nature's embrace, our spirits gently swayed,
Where peace and beauty stories yet untold.
