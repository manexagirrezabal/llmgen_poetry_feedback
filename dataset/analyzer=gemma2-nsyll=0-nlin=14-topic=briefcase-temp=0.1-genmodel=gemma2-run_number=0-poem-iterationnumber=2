Leather shell, a trusted friend,
A briefcase holds where journeys end.
Within its depths, ambition sleeps,
And whispered secrets softly creep.

From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
It carries burdens, hopes, and feats.
The click of latches, sharp and clear,
Announces plans both far and near.

A silent witness to the day,
Of triumphs won and dreams astray.
So raise a glass to this faithful guide,
That walks beside us, side by side.
