The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting the beauty that nature keeps.
In this serene world, I find my peace,
A sense of wonder that never will cease.
