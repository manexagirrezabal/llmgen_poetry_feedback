 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter echoes, tears gently fall,
A bond unbreakable, standing tall.
Through storms and sunshine, side by side,
Love's guiding light, a constant tide.
Forever yours, and you are mine. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  😊  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ✍️✨
