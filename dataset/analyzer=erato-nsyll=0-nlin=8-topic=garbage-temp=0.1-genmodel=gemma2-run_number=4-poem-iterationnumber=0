A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now trash sets free.
Bottles and cans, a tangled mess,
Forgotten wrappers, a careless caress.
Landfills grow wider, a silent blight,
Our planet groans under this heavy weight.
Let's mend our ways, with conscious care,
And leave a legacy beyond compare.
