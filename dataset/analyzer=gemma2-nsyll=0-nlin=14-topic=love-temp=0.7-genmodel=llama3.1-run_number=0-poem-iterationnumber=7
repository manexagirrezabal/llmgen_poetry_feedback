Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A guiding light on darkest night.
It's the whispered words in a lover's ear,
The gentle touch that calms all fear.

With every beat of a loving heart,
It finds its way to never be apart.
Through laughter and tears, it stands tall,
A constant presence through it all.

Love is a journey we take with glee,
A dance of two hearts beating as one family.
In its warmth, our souls find a home,
Where love resides, and never leaves alone.

With every kiss, our love grows strong,
Forever entwined, in a loving song.
