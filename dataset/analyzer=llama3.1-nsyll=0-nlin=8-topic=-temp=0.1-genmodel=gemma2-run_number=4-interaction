 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
On velvet skies, where shadows leer.
A whisper sighs through leaves so green,
A symphony of nature unseen.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Illuminate the silent night.
And in this hush, a soul takes flight,
Lost in dreams, bathed in moon's soft light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.
