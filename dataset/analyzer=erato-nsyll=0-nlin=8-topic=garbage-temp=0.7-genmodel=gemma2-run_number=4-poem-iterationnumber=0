A mountain of refuse, a sorry sight,
Plastic and paper, a dismal blight.
Food scraps and bottles, a pungent stew,
Landfills overflowing, what can we do?
Wastefulness rampant, a careless trend,
Our planet groans under this burden we send.
Let's mend our ways, reduce and reuse,
For future generations, let's find the right muse.
