 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
On velvet skies, where shadows leer.
A whisper sighs through leaves so green,
A symphony of nature's unseen.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Illuminate the silent night.
And in this hush, a soul takes flight,
Lost in dreams, bathed in moonlit light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  😊  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing prompt! ✍️✨
