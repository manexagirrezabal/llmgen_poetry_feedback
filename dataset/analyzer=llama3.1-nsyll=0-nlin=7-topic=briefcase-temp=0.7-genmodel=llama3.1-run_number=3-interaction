 > assistant: A leather satchel, worn with care,
Its contents hidden, beyond compare.

Papers and pens, in perfect array.
The businessman clutches it tight,
As he rushes through morning light,
His briefcase companion, a trusted sight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
