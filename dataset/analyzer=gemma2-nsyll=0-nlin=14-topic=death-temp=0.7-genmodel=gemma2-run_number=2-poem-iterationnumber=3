The final curtain falls, the stage is dark,
A silent hush descends upon the air.
No longer beating, life's relentless spark
Has dimmed, leaving echoes of love and care.

But in the tapestry of memory's hold,
Threads of laughter, joy, and whispered dreams,
Remain entwined, a story to be told,
Of moments shared, like sunlit, golden beams.

Though grief may linger, like a mournful song,
And tears may flow, a cleansing, bittersweet cascade,
The soul ascends, where it truly belongs,
To realms of light, where shadows gently fade. 

So let us cherish every fleeting day,
And find solace in love's enduring way.
