A silent guardian, sleek and small,
It stands unseen, answering every call.
Packets of data, a constant stream,
Through its circuits, a digital dream.

Connecting worlds with invisible threads,
Sharing stories, knowledge spreads.
From distant shores to homes nearby,
The router weaves a web that can't be defied.

A pulse within the network's heart,
Guiding information, playing its part.
Without its hum, our world would stall,
Lost in silence, beyond the wall.

So raise a glass to this humble device,
The unseen hero, keeping us nice.
