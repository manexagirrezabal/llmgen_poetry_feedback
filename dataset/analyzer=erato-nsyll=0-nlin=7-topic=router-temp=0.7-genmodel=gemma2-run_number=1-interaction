 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of magic, small and bright,
It weaves a web, both day and night.
Connecting worlds with unseen thread,
From distant screens to voices said.
Data flows like rivers strong,
Through circuits humming all day long.
The router's heart, a steady beat. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
