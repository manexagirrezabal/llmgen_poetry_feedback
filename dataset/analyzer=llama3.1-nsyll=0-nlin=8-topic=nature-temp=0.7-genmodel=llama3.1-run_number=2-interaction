 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Rays of sunshine filter through the trees,
A gentle breeze rustles the leaves with ease.
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
Inviting all to wander, wild and serene.

A brook babbles on, its melodic song,
As petals bloom, and colors dance along.
Nature's beauty, pure and strong and free,
A symphony of wonder, for you and me.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create a poem for you. If you want another one, feel free to ask!
