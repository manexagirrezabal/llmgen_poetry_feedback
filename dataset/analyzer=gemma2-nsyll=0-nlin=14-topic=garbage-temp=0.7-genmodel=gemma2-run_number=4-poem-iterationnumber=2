A plastic sea, where bottles softly sway,
And cans rust whisper tales of yesterday.
Forgotten meals, in paper wrappers lay,
A monument to waste, come what may.

The stench of rot, a symphony of grime,
Where nature's balance teeters on the line.
Landfills rise, consuming space and time,
A silent burden, on this weary clime.

But even here, a stubborn flower blooms,
Amongst the refuse, finding fertile rooms.
A fragile hope, dispelling all glooms,
To mend our ways, and banish waste's tombs.
