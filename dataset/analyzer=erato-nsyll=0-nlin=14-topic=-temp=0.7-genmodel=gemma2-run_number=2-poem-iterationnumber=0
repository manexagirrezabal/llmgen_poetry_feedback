The wind whispers secrets through leaves of jade,
A symphony of rustles, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadows, gold cascade,
Where daisies dance and buttercups aglow.

A robin sings a melody so sweet,
A chorus joins, a vibrant summer sound.
Tiny dragonflies on nimble feet,
Across the pond, their jeweled wings abound.

The air is thick with scent of honeysuckle,
And buzzing bees collect their golden prize.
Time slows its pace, a gentle, calming buckle,
As nature's beauty captivates my eyes.

In this tranquil haven, worries cease to be,
And peace descends upon serenity.
