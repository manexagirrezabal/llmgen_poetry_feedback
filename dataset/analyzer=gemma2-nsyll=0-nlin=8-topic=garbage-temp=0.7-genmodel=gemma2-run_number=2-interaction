 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where broken toys and wrappers hide.
The stench of rot, a sickly sweet,
As maggots feast on what we meet.
A landfill's heart, a somber mound,
Where nature's balance can be found,
Yet choked by waste, a silent plea,
To change our ways, for you and me. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if I can write anything else for you!
