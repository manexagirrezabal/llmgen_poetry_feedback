In darkness lies the final sleep
A silence that our souls can keep
The heart beats last, then still and cold
As life's warm flame begins to unfold

The body weakens, frail and grey
The mind falters, fades away
 Memories of love, of laughter, lost
Ephemeral moments, forever crossed

In death's dark veil, we find our fate
A mystery that waits, an endless state
No answers given, no reprieve to claim
Just a quiet end, a final, fading flame

And when the last breath is drawn and gone
The living mourn, their grief now strong
