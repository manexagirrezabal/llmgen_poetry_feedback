A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and documents to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets and offices, all day long
Its contents unknown, yet carefully kept
A mystery hidden, in its depths asleep

In meetings and deals, it plays a part
A trusted companion, never to depart
From the shoulder of one who wears it with pride
A badge of success, as the day subsides

The briefcase closes, its work is done
Its secrets safe, until the next day's won
