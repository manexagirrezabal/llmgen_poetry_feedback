 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams to weave their mystic will

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the night grows low
The wind whispers secrets through the trees so tall
And rustles leaves that softly fall

In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The world's loud din and chaos fade away
As I stand here, in this peaceful day

The darkness shines with a gentle light
Filling my heart with wonder and delight
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad you enjoyed the poem. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
