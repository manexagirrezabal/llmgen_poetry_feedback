 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be defined,
A bond between two souls intertwined.
It brings us joy, it brings us pain,
But in its depths, our hearts remain.
Forever connected, love will always sustain.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something you enjoyed. If you want more poems or have a specific request, feel free to ask!
