The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting the beauty that nature keeps.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight to see,
A reminder of wonder that's meant to be.
