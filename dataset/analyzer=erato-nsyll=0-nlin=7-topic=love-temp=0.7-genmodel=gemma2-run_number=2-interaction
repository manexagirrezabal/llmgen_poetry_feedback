 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a gentle touch,
A spark that ignites, loved oh so much.
Hearts entwined, a symphony,
Of laughter shared and tears set free.
Two souls connect, a sacred bond,
In love's embrace, forever fond.
A timeless dance, eternally.
