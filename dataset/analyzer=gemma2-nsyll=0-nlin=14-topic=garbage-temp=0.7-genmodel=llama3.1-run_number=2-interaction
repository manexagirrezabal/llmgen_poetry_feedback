 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Garbage piles high on the ground
A smelly mess all around
Food and drink containers abound
Plastic bags tangled up profound

Discarded papers scattered wide
Old newspapers, crumpled with pride
Glass bottles shattered on the floor
Their fragments a hazardous score

The earth protests with every heap
As toxins seep from each dark creep
The air grows thick with stench and grime
A reflection of our waste's crime

We must take care to reduce and reuse
And recycle, for our future's muse
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem that highlights the importance of taking care of our environment. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
