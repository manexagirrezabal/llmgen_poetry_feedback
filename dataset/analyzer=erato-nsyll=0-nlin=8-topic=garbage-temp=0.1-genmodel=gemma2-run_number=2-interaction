 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Bottles and boxes, a tangled array,
Whispering tales of a wasteful day.
Landfills groan, a silent despair,
As nature cries out, "Is this all we share?"
Let's mend our ways, with conscious thought,
And leave a legacy, cleanly wrought. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
