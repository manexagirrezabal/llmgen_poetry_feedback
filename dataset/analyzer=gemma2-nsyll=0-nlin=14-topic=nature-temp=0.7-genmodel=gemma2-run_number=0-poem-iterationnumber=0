Sunlight spills through leaves of emerald green,
A dappled dance upon the forest floor.
A gentle breeze whispers secrets unseen,
As wildflowers bloom, their petals adore.
The babbling brook sings a melodious tune,
Its crystal waters sparkle in the light.
Birdsong fills the air, a vibrant croon,
A symphony of nature, pure and bright.
Beneath a canopy of branches tall,
Peace descends upon this tranquil scene.
Where worries fade and spirits rise and fall,
In harmony with nature's gentle glean.
So breathe it in, this beauty all around,
Let nature's solace soothe your heart profound.
