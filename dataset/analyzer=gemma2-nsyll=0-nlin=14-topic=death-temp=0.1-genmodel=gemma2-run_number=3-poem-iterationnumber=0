A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze that whispers through the trees,
Carries a sigh, a soul set gently free.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories linger, cherished and confessed.

Though darkness claims us all, in time's embrace,
Love's embers glow, leaving an enduring trace.
A tapestry of moments, woven bright,
Shines through the veil, a beacon in the night.

And though we part, our spirits intertwine,
In cosmic dance, forever yours and mine.
