Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

With every kiss, our hearts beat fast,
Our love for each other will forever last.
In your eyes, my heart finds a home,
Where I am safe, where I am never alone.

Your love is my shelter from life's stormy sea,
My guiding star that shines bright and free.
Together we'll weather any test of time,
And our love will be the anchor that holds us in rhyme.

Our love story is one for the ages told,
A tale of devotion that will forever unfold.
