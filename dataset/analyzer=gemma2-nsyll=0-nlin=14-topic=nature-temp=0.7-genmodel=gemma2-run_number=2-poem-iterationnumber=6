Sunlight spills across the dew-kissed grass,
A gentle warmth upon the morning air.
Birdsong fills the trees, a sweet, soft mass,
As nature wakes from slumber, free of care.

Golden leaves dance in the breeze so light,
While squirrels chase acorns through the branches high.
A babbling brook reflects the day's first sight,
Where dragonflies on gossamer wings fly by.

Through fields of wildflowers, colors brightly gleam,
A tapestry of beauty, rich and grand.
In nature's embrace, a tranquil, peaceful dream,
Where worries fade and spirits understand.
