A somber sentinel of polished brown,
The briefcase stands, its secrets tightly bound.
Within its depths, ambition takes its hold,
Dreams whispered softly, stories yet untold.

Contracts inked in haste, decisions made,
Triumphs and failures, fortunes to be weighed.
It walks beside us through the city's throng,
A silent witness to our lives, both weak and strong.

From boardroom battles to a quiet street,
It carries burdens, heavy on its seat.
A symbol etched in metal, dark and sleek,
The briefcase holds the world, within its peak.
