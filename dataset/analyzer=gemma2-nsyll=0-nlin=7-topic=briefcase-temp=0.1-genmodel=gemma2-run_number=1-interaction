 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams amassed.
Within its depths, ambition sleeps,
And futures forged in boardroom leaps.
A silent witness to each deal,
A trusted friend, it will reveal
The weight of power, hopes concealed. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
