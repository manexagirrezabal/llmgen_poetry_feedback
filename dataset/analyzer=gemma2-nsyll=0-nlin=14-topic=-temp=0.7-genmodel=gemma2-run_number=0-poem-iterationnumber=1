The twilight paints the sky in hues of gray,
A canvas brushed with soft and fading light.
Long shadows stretch, where birds once flew and played,
And whispers rustle through the coming night.

A lone star shimmers, a beacon in the dark,
While crickets chirp their symphony so sweet.
The world grows still, a peaceful, gentle spark,
As worries fade and weary souls retreat.

Beneath the moon's soft, silvery embrace,
The flowers close their petals, hushed and deep.
A sense of calm descends upon this place,
Where nature slumbers, secrets to keep.

And in this quiet, we find solace true,
A moment's peace before the day anew.
