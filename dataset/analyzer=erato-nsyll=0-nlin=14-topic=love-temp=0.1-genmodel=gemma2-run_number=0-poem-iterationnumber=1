A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A silent spark that sets my heart aflame.
Your laughter echoes, chasing away gloom,
And in your eyes, I see a love untamed.

We walk hand-in-hand through fields of gold,
Sharing secrets whispered on the breeze.
Each moment precious, stories to be told,
Of dreams we weave beneath the ancient trees.

A tapestry of moments, woven tight,
With threads of joy and sorrow intertwined.
Your love, a beacon shining ever bright,
Guiding me through darkness, peace I find.

Forever bound, our souls will intertwine,
In this love story, forever yours and mine.
