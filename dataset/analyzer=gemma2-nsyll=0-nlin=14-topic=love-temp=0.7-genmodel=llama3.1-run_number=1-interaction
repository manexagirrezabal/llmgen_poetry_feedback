 > assistant: Soft whispers in the dead of night
Flickering candles, warm and bright
Two hearts beating as one, they find
A love so pure, it touches mind

In eyes that shine like stars above
They see a future built on endless love
Their laughter echoes through the day
As they dance to the rhythm of life's way

With every kiss, their souls entwine
Their love grows strong, a bond divine
Through trials and tribulations, they stand
Hand in hand, forever in each other's hand

In this love, they find their peaceful nest
Where hearts are safe, and love is at its best
