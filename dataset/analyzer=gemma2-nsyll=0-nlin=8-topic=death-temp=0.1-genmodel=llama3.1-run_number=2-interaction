 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, unseen and cold
That claims the living, young and old

With gentle touch or fierce decree
It takes the breath from mortal sea
Leaving behind a hollow space
And memories of a life erased
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic, feel free to ask!
