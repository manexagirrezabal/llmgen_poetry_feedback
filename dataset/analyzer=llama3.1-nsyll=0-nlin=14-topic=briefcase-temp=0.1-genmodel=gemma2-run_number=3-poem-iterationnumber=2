A leather shell, a sturdy frame of brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily toil.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, hopes that will not spoil.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, futures dearly bought,
And promises embraced, a future traced.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks the path of progress, day by day.
A symbol of ambition, goals we meet,
Or chase with fervor, come what may.
