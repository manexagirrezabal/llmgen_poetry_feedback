Leather bound, a fortress sleek and black,
A silent sentinel on hurried track.
It holds the weight of dreams, both grand and small,
Within its depths, ambitions rise and fall.

From boardroom glare to city's neon gleam,
It walks beside, a constant, trusted beam.
Each clasp a promise, whispered in the hush,
Of deals secured, and futures built on trust.

But sometimes closed, it speaks a lonely tale,
Of burdens borne, and victories that fail.
A weathered witness to ambition's quest,
A silent guide, through life's relentless test.

So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase strong, until the very end.
