 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that cannot be tamed,
A passion that forever remains.
In its depths, we find our peaceful place,
Where joy and happiness fill every space,
And in each other's love, we're never alone.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy the poem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
