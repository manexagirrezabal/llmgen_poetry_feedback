 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent shadows creep at night
Death's dark whisper, a lonely light
A fleeting breath, a final sigh
The end of all, a mysterious sky
In darkness lies the unknown fate
Where shadows dance, and souls relate
Eternal rest, a quiet state
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
