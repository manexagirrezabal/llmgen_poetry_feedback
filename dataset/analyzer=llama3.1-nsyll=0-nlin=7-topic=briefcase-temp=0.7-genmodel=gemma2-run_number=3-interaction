 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
With clasps that snap and hinges down,
It holds the weight of dreams and schemes,
Of deals made bold, of whispered themes.
Within its depths, a world unseen,
Where futures bloom or fade, I glean,
The power lies in what it means. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you have any other requests. ğŸ˜Š
