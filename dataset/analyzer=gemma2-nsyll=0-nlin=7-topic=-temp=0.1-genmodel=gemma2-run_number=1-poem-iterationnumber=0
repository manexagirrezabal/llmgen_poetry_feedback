The moon, a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Hangs heavy, casting shadows long and deep.
A whisper stirs the leaves, a gentle verse
Of rustling secrets that the branches keep.
Stars like diamonds scattered on black cloth,
Twinkle softly, watching over sleep.
And silence reigns, a blanket soft as moth.
