A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through crowded streets, all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery wrapped, in a story to hold

In meetings and deals, it plays its part
A trusted companion, never to depart
From the shoulder of one who wears it with pride
It's a badge of success, that glides with stride

Through life's ups and downs, it stands tall
A faithful friend, through it all
