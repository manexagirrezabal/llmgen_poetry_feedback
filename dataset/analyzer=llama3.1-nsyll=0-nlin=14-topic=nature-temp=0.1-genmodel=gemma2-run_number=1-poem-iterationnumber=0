The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
While fireflies ignite, like scattered jewels,
And shadows dance, beyond compare.

The whispering wind through leaves a lullaby,
A gentle breeze that carries scents so sweet,
Of blooming flowers reaching for the sky,
And mossy stones where tiny creatures meet.

The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting its glow upon the sleeping land,
Stars twinkle bright, against the velvet night,
A tapestry of wonder, close at hand.

Nature's embrace, a solace and delight,
Where peace resides, both day and darkest night.
