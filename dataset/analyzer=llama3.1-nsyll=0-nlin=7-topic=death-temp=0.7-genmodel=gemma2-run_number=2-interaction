 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a silent sigh,
A fading light in weary eye.
The body rests, a shell now still,
While memories dance upon the hill.
Life's tapestry, unfurled and spun,
Now fades to shades of setting sun.
The journey ends, but love remains.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
