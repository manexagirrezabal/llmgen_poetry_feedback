Of leather bound, a fortress sleek and dark,
It holds ambitions, etched within its mark.
A silent witness to the deals that rise,
And whispers tales of fortunes, dreams, and sighs.

From crowded halls to quiet office space,
It strides with purpose, finding its own place.
Each clasp a promise, held in measured grace,
Of futures built on trust, and time's embrace.

But when it sleeps, a story can unfold,
Of burdens carried, victories untold.
A weathered sentinel, through thick and thin,
The briefcase stands, where journeys begin.
