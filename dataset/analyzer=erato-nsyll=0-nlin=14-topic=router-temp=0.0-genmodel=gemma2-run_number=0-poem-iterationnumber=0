A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It hums and glows, a beacon in the night,
Connecting worlds with data's swift flight.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a path, a virtual scene.
Emails fly, and games take hold,
Stories shared, both new and old.

A gateway to knowledge, vast and wide,
The router stands, a constant guide.
Through fiber optic strands it sends its call,
Connecting hearts, answering every thrall.

So let us praise this humble device,
That bridges gaps and makes connections nice.
