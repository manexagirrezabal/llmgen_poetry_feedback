 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death comes with silence, end of day
A whispered promise, void of pain
A final sleep, from which we cannot gain

The heart that beats, now still and cold
 Memories linger, young and old
In darkness deep, our souls take flight
Into the night, without a light
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
