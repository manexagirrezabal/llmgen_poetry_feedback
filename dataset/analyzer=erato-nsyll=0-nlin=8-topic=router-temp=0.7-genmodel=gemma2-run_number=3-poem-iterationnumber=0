A silent sentinel, it sits unseen,
A web of signals, a digital dream.
Packets travel, a constant flow,
Connecting worlds, helping knowledge grow.
From distant shores to your very hand,
It guides the data, a tireless command.
The router's hum, a gentle refrain,
Weaving connections, easing the strain.
