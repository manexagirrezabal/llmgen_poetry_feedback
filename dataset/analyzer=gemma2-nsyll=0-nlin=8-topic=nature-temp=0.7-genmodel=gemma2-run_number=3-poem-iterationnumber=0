Sun-dappled leaves in emerald dance,
Whispering secrets on a summer trance.
A babbling brook, a melody so sweet,
Where dragonflies on painted wings do fleet.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues so bold,
A symphony of scents, stories untold.
Nature's embrace, a gentle, calming sigh,
Beneath the vast and endless, azure sky.
