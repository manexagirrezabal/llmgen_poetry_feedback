 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, sleek and small,
It sits unseen, yet rules them all.
Packets dance upon its wires thin,
Connecting worlds, where dreams begin.
From distant shores to screens nearby,
The router's hum, a lullaby,
Of endless data, flowing free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
