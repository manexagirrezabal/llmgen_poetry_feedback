 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, dark and bold,
It holds the weight of dreams and stories told.
Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Contracts signed, proposals bathed in light.

A silent witness to the daily grind,
The briefcase journeys, leaving none behind.
From boardroom meetings to coffee shop's embrace,
It carries burdens with a measured pace.

A symbol of success, a badge of pride,
It speaks of deals and futures intertwined.
But more than just a case of metal sheen,
It holds the essence of what life has been.

And when its clasp is closed, at day's last call,
The briefcase waits, for stories to enthrall. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
