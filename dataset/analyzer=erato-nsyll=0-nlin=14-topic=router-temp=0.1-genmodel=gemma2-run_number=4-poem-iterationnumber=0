A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making connections known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
Data flows like rivers, swift and strong,
Through fiber optic paths, where signals throng.

A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
To distant shores, where secrets hide.
With every click, a journey takes its flight,
The router guides us through the digital night.
A humble hero, working day and night,
Connecting hearts, in darkness or in light.
