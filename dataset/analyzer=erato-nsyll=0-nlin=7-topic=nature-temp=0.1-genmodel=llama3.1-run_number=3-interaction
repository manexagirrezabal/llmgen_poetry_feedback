 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.

Their gentle sway a soothing sight.
The river flows with waters deep,
Reflecting beauty in its sleep.
Nature's peace my soul does keep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you'd like another one, feel free to ask!
