 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent stars shine bright above
A midnight sky of endless love
The world is hushed in quiet sleep
As moonlight whispers secrets deep

The wind it stirs with gentle breeze
That rustles leaves and sways the trees
In this still hour of peaceful night
All troubles fade into pure light
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem, just let me know. I can tailor one to a specific theme or subject if you have any ideas in mind.
