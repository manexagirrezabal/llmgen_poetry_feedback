 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight paints the leaves with gold,
A gentle breeze whispers tales untold.
Birdsong fills the air so sweet,
As wildflowers dance beneath our feet.
Crystal streams meander through the green,
A symphony of life, a vibrant scene.
Nature's beauty, a timeless art.
