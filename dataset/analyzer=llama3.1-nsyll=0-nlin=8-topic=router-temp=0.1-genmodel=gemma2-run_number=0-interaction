 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Through wires and waves, it guides the flow,
Of thoughts and images, to and fro.
A hub of networks, vast and wide,
Where information freely does reside.
The router hums, a constant beat,
Keeping us linked, from head to feet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
