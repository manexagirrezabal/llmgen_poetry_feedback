 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moonbeams dance upon the lake,
A silver path for dreams to take.
The wind whispers secrets in the trees,
And fireflies ignite with gentle ease.
Stars like diamonds scattered wide,
Across a canvas dark and deep inside.
The world is hushed, a silent plea,
For peace and rest eternally. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
