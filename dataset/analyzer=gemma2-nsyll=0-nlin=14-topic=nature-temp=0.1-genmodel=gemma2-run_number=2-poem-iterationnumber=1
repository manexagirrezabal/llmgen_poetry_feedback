Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets untold,
Flowers unfurl, a vibrant, colorful scene,
As nature's symphony begins to unfold.

A babbling brook dances over smooth stones,
Reflecting azure skies, so bright and clear,
While birdsong fills the air with joyful tones,
Chasing away shadows, banishing fear.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Invites the soul to wander, free and light,
Where ancient trees their silent stories send,
And stars ignite the canvas of the night.

In nature's embrace, we find our peace profound,
A sanctuary where worries gently drown.
