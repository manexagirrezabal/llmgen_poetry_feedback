 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed, a peaceful sight
As stars above shine with all their light

The wind whispers secrets through the trees
A gentle breeze that rustles summer's ease
The scent of blooms and fresh-cut grass
Fills lungs with joy and calm at last

In this still hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm that worldly cares release
My heart beats slow, my soul takes flight
As darkness reigns, and all is right

The night's sweet solace wraps me tight
And in its silence, I take flight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
