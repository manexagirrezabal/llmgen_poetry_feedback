A silent curtain falls, the light departs,
A final breath, a whisper on the breeze.
The tapestry of life unwinds its arts,
And leaves behind a void that softly grieves.

No longer bound by mortal chains and flesh,
The soul takes flight upon an unseen wing,
To realms unknown, where whispers gently mesh,
And memories dance, forevermore to sing.

But here on earth, the echo lingers still,
A vacant chair, a voice that's gone unheard,
A love remembered, etched upon the hill,
A poignant tale, by whispered words preferred.

So let us mourn, yet find a solace deep,
In knowing death's embrace is but a sleep.
