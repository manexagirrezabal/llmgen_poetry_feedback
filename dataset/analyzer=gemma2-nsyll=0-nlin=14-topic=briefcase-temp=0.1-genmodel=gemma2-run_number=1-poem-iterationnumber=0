A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
Holds secrets whispered, deals struck down.
Within its depths, ambition takes flight,
Dreams and deadlines, day and night.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop chats,
It carries burdens, maps out future paths.
A silent witness to triumphs and woes,
The briefcase travels where the story goes.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality sound,
Leaving behind the chaos it has found.
A symbol of progress, a tool of trade,
In its embrace, fortunes are made.

But empty now, it waits for the next quest,
To be filled with purpose, and put to the test.
