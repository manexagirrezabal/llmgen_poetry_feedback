 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be defined,
A gentle touch that soothes the mind.
With every kiss, our love will grow,
Together forever, our hearts will glow.
In each other's arms, we'll find our home.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you'd like another one or any modifications to this one, just let me know!
