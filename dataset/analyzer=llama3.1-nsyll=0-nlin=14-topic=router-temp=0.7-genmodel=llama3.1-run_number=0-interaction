 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it stands so tall,
A gateway to the digital hall.
The router guides our internet ways,
Connecting us through endless days.

With Wi-Fi signals strong and bright,
It beams out info, day and night.
Through cables twisted, turned with care,
It brings us speed, beyond compare.

Its settings tweaked, its power set free,
It allocates bandwidth for you and me.
In homes, in offices, it's a must-have friend,
Helping us stay connected till the very end.

With passwords hidden, safely stored away,
The router guards our digital day.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
