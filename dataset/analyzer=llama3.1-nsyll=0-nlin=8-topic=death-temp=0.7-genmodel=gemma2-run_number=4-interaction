 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a final breath,
The curtain falls, a life in death.
No longer bound by earthly ties,
A journey starts beyond the skies.
Though tears may fall and hearts may ache,
Remember love that memories make.
In silent sleep, a soul takes flight,
To realms of peace, beyond the night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.  âœ¨
