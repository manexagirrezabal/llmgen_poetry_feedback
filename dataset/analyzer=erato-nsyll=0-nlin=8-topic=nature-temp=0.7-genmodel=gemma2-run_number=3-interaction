 > assistant: Sunlight dapples through leaves so green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets unseen.
Flowers bloom in vibrant array,
Butterflies dance on wings of gray.
Birdsong fills the air with cheer,
Nature's symphony, crystal clear.
Peace and beauty, a calming sight,
In every leaf, a pure delight.  



 > human: Thank you!
