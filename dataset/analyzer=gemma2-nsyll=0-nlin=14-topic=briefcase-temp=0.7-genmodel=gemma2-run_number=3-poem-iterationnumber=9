A leather shell, a fortress dark and strong,
It holds ambitions, where they truly belong.
Through bustling streets and boardrooms cold and grand,
It strides beside, a silent, trusted hand.

With every click, a promise takes its stand,
Of deals secured, across the shifting sand.
But when it sleeps, beneath the moonlit sky,
It whispers tales of dreams that soar so high.

A weathered map of triumphs yet to be,
The briefcase stands, a constant symphony.
So raise a glass to this enduring friend,
Whose steadfast form will journey without end.
