 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It hums and glows, a beacon in the night,
Connecting worlds with data's swift flight.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a path, a virtual scene.
Emails fly, and games ignite their spark,
Streaming whispers through the digital dark.

A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
Where information flows on every tide.
But hidden deep within its plastic shell,
A complex dance of packets, stories tell.

So thank the router, humble and discreet,
For bridging gaps and making connections sweet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
