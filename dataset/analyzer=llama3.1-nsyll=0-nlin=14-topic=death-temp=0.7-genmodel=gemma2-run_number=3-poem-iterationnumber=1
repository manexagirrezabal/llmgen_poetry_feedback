A veil descends, a hush falls on the day,
As life's last flicker fades into the night.
The heart that pulsed with joy now slips away,
And stars replace the fading candlelight.

A silent breath, a stillness in the room,
A vacant space where laughter once did dwell.
But memories bloom, like flowers in full bloom,
And stories whispered, love's sweet magic tell.

Though tears may flow and sorrow fills the air,
Know that this journey is not truly done.
For in the quiet whispers of a prayer,
A soul takes flight, a new adventure begun.

The cycle turns, from darkness into dawn,
A promise held, until our time is gone.
