A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets flow through its intricate design,
A web of signals, ever intertwine.
From home to office, school to distant shore,
It bridges gaps and opens every door.
The router hums, a tireless, steady beat,
Guiding information, making connections sweet.
