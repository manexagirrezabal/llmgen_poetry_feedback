The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds in hues of orange bright.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so high,
As stars begin to pierce the coming night.

The world grows still, a hush descends on all,
Save for the crickets' chorus, soft and sweet.
A silver moon ascends, her watchful call,
Casting its glow on paths where shadows meet.

A solitary owl, with silent wings,
Embarks upon its hunt beneath the stars.
And dreams take flight, on whispered, hopeful things,
As darkness claims the world, and love repairs.

So let us sleep, beneath this velvet sky,
And wake to greet the sun, reborn and high.
