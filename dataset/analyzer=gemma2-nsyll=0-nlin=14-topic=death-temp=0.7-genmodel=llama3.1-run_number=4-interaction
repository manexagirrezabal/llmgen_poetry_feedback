 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark form slips in to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He claims the soul from mortal land

His whispered voice, a soft goodbye
Echoes through eternity's sigh
The heart, once beating strong and free
Now stills its pulse, in final sea

 Memories of life, like autumn leaves
Fade quickly, as winter's eaves
The grave, a rest, where loved ones sleep
And though we weep, they're safe to keep

In death's dark night, we find our peace
A final calm, the soul's release
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I hope you enjoyed the poem. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
