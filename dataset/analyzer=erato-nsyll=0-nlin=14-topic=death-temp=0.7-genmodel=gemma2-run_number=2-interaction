 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain drawn across the stage,
The final act, a whispered, fading sigh.
No more the laughter, no more turn of page,
Just shadows dancing 'neath a moonlit sky.
The heart that beat, now stilled and cold as stone,
The eyes that sparkled, dimmed beyond repair.
A life once vibrant, overthrown, unknown
To realms where whispers mingle with despair.
But fear not, friend, for death is but a door,
That leads to paths we cannot yet perceive.
A tapestry of stars, forevermore,
Where souls transcend and find sweet reprieve.
Though tears may fall, and grief may claim its hold,
Love's embers glow, a story yet untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You are welcome!  ğŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
