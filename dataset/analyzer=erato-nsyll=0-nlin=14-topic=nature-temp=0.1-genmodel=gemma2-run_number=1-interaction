 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets to the breeze,
As twilight's gentle touch begins to share.

A silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Upon the sleeping world, serene and deep,
Stars like diamonds scattered in the sky,
While fireflies dance, their silent vigil keep.

The scent of pine and damp earth fills the night,
A rustling sound, a creature takes its flight,
Nature's embrace, a solace to the soul,
Where worries fade and peace begins to stroll.

In this hushed realm, where beauty softly reigns,
We find ourselves renewed, cleansed by nature's strains. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
