Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A tender kiss that makes our heart whole.

In love's sweet arms, we find our peace,
A place to rest where worries cease.
With every beat, our love will grow,
Forever entwined, our hearts will glow.
