 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In wireless world, it stands so tall,
A device that connects us all.
The router's hum, a constant beat,
It transmits signals to our feet.
Through Wi-Fi waves, it brings us near,
To a digital realm without fear.
Connecting lives, with every share.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy the poem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
