 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness lies the silent sleep
Where shadows dance and whispers creep
The final breath that seals our fate
A moment's pause before life waits

The heart that beats no longer strong
The soul that flees to a new song
Death's cold hand that gently takes
And leaves behind a hollow ache
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about death that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
