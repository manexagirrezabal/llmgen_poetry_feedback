A briefcase, worn and weathered by the years,
Holds secrets whispered, hopes and drying tears.
It travels paths of triumph and of strife,
Through bustling cities, changing day to night.

Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Deals struck with purpose, bathed in golden light.
A silent witness to the human race,
The briefcase carries burdens, time and space.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality profound,
As shadows lengthen on familiar ground.
A symbol of progress, a tool refined,
In its embrace, destinies are entwined.
