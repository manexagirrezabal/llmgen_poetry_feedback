A silent breath, a final whispered sigh,
The fading light where life's bright flame did lie.
No more the pulse, the rhythm of the heart,
Just peaceful rest, a brand new work to start.

The body sleeps, a journey now complete,
While memories dance, bittersweet and sweet.
But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding our souls through darkness, shining bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the day,
Hope's gentle hand will lead us on our way.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
