 > assistant: Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful evening, twilight high.
Stars appear, one by one so bright,
Night's soft silence, a gentle night.
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep,
Dreams of tomorrow, secrets keep.
Moonlight whispers, a peaceful creep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you want another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
