 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, data flowing keen.
Connecting worlds with every passing byte,
From distant shores to screens bathed in light.

Through walls and ceilings, signals take their flight,
A symphony of packets, day and night.
It knows no rest, this tireless, watchful soul,
Guiding whispers through its digital hole.

IP addresses, gateways open wide,
Sharing stories, secrets deep inside.
A humble box, yet power it displays,
Connecting lives in countless intricate ways.

So let us praise the router's unseen grace,
The bridge between worlds, in time and space. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?  âœ¨
