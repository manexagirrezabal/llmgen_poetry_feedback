 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.
In its presence, fears begin to fade,
And with it, our hearts are made.
Forever entwined, love will always stay.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
