 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent hum, a network's heart,
Connecting worlds, playing its part.
Data flows through wires unseen,
The router weaves, a digital scene.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
