 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent guardian, unseen and small,
Connecting worlds within its wall.
Packets fly on wireless wings,
Bridging gaps, answering pings.
From streaming shows to distant calls,
It weaves a web where data sprawls.
A humble hero, ever near,
The router keeps our world sincere. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
