A whispered word, a tender embrace so deep,
Love's gentle touch, secrets we keep.
Two hearts entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's sweet dance, time and space erase.

Through fields of gold and skies of endless blue,
Love's guiding star, forever shining through.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths unknown,
Sharing laughter, making dreams our own.

With every glance, a spark ignites anew,
A love that burns with passion, strong and true.
No distance vast, no time can ever tear,
This bond we share, beyond all compare.
Two souls united, forever meant to be.
