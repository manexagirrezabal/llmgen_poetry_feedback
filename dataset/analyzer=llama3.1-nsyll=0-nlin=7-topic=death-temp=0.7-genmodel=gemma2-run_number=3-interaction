 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.

In whispers soft, both new and old.
The body sleeps, the spirit free,
Beyond the veil, for all to see.
Life's tapestry, forever sewn.
