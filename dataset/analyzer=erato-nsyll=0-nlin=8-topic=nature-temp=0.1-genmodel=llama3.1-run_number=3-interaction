 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting the beauty that nature keeps.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight to see,
A reminder of wonder that's wild and free.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
