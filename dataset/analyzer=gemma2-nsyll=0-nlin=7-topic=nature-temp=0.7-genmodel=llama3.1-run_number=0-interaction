 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wildflowers in glee.
In forests deep, where ancient secrets sleep,
Rivers flow, their waters soft and deep.
Nature's beauty is a gift to keep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a little poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
