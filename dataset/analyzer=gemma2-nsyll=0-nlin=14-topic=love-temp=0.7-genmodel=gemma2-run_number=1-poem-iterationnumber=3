Your laughter echoes through my soul's embrace,
A melody that fills this empty space.
With every glance, my heart leaps to ignite,
A flame awakened by your radiant light.

Your touch, a feather, soft upon my skin,
Awakens longings deep within.
We walk as one, beneath the moonlit sky,
Two souls entwined, our spirits soaring high.

The world fades away, leaving only us,
Lost in a moment, sealed with a tender kiss.
Our love, a beacon, shining ever bright,
Guiding our path through darkest night.
