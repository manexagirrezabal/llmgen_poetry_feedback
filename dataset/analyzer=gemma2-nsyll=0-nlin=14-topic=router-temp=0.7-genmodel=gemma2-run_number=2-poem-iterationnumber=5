A box of circuits, humming in the night,
Connecting worlds with digital light.
It spins a web where data takes its flight,
A silent guardian, keeping signals bright.

From distant shores to screens held in our hand,
It bridges gaps across the digital land.
Packets race through wires, swift and bold,
Stories shared, connections unfold.

The router stands, a humble, steadfast guide,
Guiding voices, data side by side.
No longer bound by miles or time's embrace,
We're linked together in this digital space.
