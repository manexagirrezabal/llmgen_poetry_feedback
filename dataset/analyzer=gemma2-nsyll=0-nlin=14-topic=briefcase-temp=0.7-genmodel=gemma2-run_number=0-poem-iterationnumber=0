A humble box of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and plans unknown.
Within its clasp, ambitions take their flight,
And futures shimmer in the fading light.
From boardroom battles to coffee shop schemes,
The briefcase whispers tales of waking dreams.
It bears the scars of journeys long and far,
A silent witness to a shining star.
With every click, a story unfolds,
Of triumphs won and lessons yet untold.
A symbol of success, a tool of trade,
It carries burdens that must be displayed.
So raise a glass to this humble friend,
The briefcase journey without end.
