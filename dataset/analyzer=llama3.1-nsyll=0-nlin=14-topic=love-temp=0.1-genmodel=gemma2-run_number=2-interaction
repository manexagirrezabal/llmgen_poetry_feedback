 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A symphony of hearts, a rhythmic beat.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.
A sanctuary found in each other's eyes,
Where trust resides and hope forever flies.

With every passing day, the love grows strong,
A melody that plays, a timeless song.
Two lives united, destinies aligned,
In love's embrace, true happiness we find. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 12 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A spark ignites, dispelling all the gloom.
Two hearts entwined, a rhythm soft and low,
A silent language only love can know.

With gentle touch, a world begins to bloom,
Where dreams take flight and banish every doom.
Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.

A sanctuary found in each other's eyes,
Where trust resides and hope forever flies.
Two souls united, destinies aligned,
In love's embrace, true happiness we find.
