A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, data's flowing stream.
It guides the packets, whispers through the night,
Connecting worlds with ethereal light.

From laptop screens to smartphones held so tight,
It bridges gaps, a digital delight.
No hero's cape, no fanfare in its wake,
But knowledge shared, for every soul to take.

A humming heart, a pulse within the wall,
It keeps us linked, answering duty's call.
So let us praise this humble, vital tool,
That weaves a tapestry, both vast and cool.

The router reigns, unseen but ever near,
A guardian of connection, banishing fear.
