A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and documents with fame

It's carried by hands that are strong and sure
Through streets and offices, it's always pure
A trusted companion, through day and night
Protecting its contents, with all its might

Inside, papers rustle, and pens do lie
Important meetings, and deals to apply
The briefcase is a vessel, of business and fate
A keeper of secrets, that only few can relate

It's opened and closed, with a confident stride
A trusted ally, by the executive's side
