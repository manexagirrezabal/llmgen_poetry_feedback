A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now rot sets free.
Tin cans clanging, paper's brittle sigh,
Ghosts of meals past, beneath a leaden sky.
Forgotten treasures, cast aside with haste,
A testament to waste, an endless taste
Of careless habits, a world undone,
Until we learn, the Earth is not our one.
