A hush descends, the world holds its breath still,
As life's last flicker fades upon the hill.
No more the laughter, tears that once did flow,
Just quiet peace where gentle shadows grow.

The sun dips low, a crimson kiss goodbye,
And stars ignite against the darkening sky.
But memories dance, like fireflies at night,
Of moments shared, and love's enduring light.

A tapestry of dreams, now softly spun,
Where earthly threads are gently overcome.
Though bodies rest, and spirits take their flight,
Love's gentle echo lingers in the night.
