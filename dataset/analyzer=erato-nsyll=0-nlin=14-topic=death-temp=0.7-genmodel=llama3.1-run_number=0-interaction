 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come sweeping by each day
With whispered secrets, and silent pace
It claims its own, in endless space

A fleeting breath, a final sigh
The heart's last beat, the eyes grow dry
The light that shone, now fades to grey
And all that's left, is darkness's sway

Yet even death, cannot stay its course
For life and death, are twined in force
They dance together, hand in hand
In eternal cycle, across the land

In death's dark veil, we find our peace
A final rest, from life's wild release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
