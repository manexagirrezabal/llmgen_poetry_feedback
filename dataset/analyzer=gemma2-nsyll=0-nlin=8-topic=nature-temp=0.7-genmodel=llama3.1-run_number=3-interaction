 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Misty mountains touch the sky,
Rivers flow with gentle sigh.
The forest whispers secrets old,
A soothing melody to unfold.

In fields of green, wildflowers sway,
Dancing in breezes on a summer's day.
The sun shines bright with warm delight,
Filling hearts with peaceful night.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
