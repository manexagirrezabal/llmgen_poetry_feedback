The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where life once held its arts.
No more the pulse, the rhythm of the day,
Just silent peace, where shadows gently sway.

The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories dance, secrets they will keep.
But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding our souls through darkness, shining bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the sky,
Hope's gentle hand will lift us, help us fly.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
