A whispered word, a touch so light and true,
Love's gentle flame, forever burning new.
Two hearts entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's embrace, we find our happy space.

Through fields of gold where sunlight softly falls,
Love's guiding star, illuminating all.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths so bright,
Sharing laughter, chasing stars with light.

With every glance, a spark ignites within,
A love that burns, a journey to begin.
No distance vast, no time can ever part,
This bond we share, forever in our heart.
Two souls united, destined to be free.
