The world grows quiet, hushed and still as night,
As life's bright flame flickers, then fades from sight.
A final breath escapes on silent wings,
And weary eyes no longer see what sings.

But memories dance like fireflies in dreams,
Reflecting moments bathed in sunlit beams.
Though tears may fall, and sorrow fills the air,
Love's gentle touch brings solace and repair.

For death is not an ending, but a sleep,
A journey to a realm where secrets keep.
And though we mourn the loss of those we knew,
Their spirits soar on wings forever true.
