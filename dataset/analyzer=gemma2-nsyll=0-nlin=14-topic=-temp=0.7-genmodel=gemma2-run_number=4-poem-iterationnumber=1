The old oak sighs, its leaves begin to fall,
A golden shower upon the waiting ground.
Sunlight streams through branches, thin and tall,
Where squirrels dart quick, their treasures tightly bound.

A robin sings a melody so sweet,
His cheerful notes a serenade to day.
And in the distance, children's laughter fleet,
As summer's warmth begins to fade away.

The air grows crisp, with whispers of the breeze,
That rustle through the grass and painted leaves.
A sense of change hangs heavy on the trees,
As autumn's touch brings beauty that deceives.

And though the days grow short, and nights descend,
There's magic in this season without end.
