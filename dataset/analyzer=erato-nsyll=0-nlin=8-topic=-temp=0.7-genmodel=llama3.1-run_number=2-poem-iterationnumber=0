Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep,
Moonlight dancing on the midnight keep.
The forest whispers secrets to the trees,
As night's dark magic weaves its gentle breeze.

The world is hushed, a peaceful sight,
Stars twinkling bright in the evening light.
A lonely owl hoots out its mournful sigh,
In this still hour, the heart can fly.
