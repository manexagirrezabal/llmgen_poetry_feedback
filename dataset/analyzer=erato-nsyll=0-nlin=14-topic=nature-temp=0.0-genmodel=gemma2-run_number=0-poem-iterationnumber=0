The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
As leaves dance gently in the cooling breeze,
And whispers rustle through the meadow fair.

A silver stream reflects the fading light,
While fireflies ignite their tiny stars,
And crickets chirp a lullaby so sweet,
Beneath a canopy of ancient scars.

The moon ascends, a pearl upon the night,
Casting its glow on sleeping fields below,
Where wildflowers dream and dewdrops softly gleam,
A tapestry of peace, where worries go.

In nature's embrace, we find solace deep,
And in her beauty, secrets gently sleep.
