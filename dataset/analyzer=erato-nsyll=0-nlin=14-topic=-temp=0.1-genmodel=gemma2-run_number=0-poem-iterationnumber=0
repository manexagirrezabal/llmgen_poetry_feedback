The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustle, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where the wildflowers grow.

A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
A mournful tune that echoes in the air.
Autumn's embrace, a bittersweet retreat,
As summer's warmth gives way to frosty stare.

The days grow shorter, shadows stretch and creep,
And nature slumbers, hushed in golden sleep.
But beauty lingers, even as it weeps,
A final dance before winter's icy keep.

So let us cherish every fading ray,
Before the darkness claims the light of day.
