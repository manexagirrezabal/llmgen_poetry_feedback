 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight dapples through leaves of green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets unseen.
Flowers bloom in vibrant array,
As birdsong fills the air all day.
A babbling brook, a crystal stream,
Reflects the sky's ethereal gleam.
Nature's canvas, vast and wide,
A masterpiece where wonders reside. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one on a different theme. ğŸŒ»
