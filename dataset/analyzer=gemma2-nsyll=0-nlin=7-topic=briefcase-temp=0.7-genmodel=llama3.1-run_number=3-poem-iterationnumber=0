A sleek and sturdy case of leather fine,
Carrying documents with precision divine.
Inside its depths, papers neatly stacked,
A businessman's trusty aid, never cracked.
The weight of responsibility it holds tight,
As he strides through offices, morning light.
His briefcase a symbol of his daily fight.
