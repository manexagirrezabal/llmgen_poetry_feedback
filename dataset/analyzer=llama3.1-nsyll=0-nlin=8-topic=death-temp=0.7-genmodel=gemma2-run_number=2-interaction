 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh,
A journey ends, beneath the sky.
No more laughter, no more tears,
Just silence falls, throughout the years.
The body sleeps, a peaceful rest,
While memories linger, in each breast.
A soul takes flight, on wings unseen,
To realms unknown, forever green. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š
