A leather shell, a clasp of brass so bright,
It holds ambitions, secrets in plain sight.
Through bustling streets, a shadow on the ground,
The briefcase walks, its purpose to be found.

Inside it sleeps a world of hopes and fears,
Of deals negotiated, whispers through the years.
A contract penned, a vision taking flight,
The weight of futures held within its light.

It strides with owners, chasing day's demands,
A silent witness to their shaking hands.
Success or failure, etched upon its side,
The briefcase waits, where fortunes can be tied.

A constant fixture, steadfast and serene,
A story whispered, in the world unseen.
