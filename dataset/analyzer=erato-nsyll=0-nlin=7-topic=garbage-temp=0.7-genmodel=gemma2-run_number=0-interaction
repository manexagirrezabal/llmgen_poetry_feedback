 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of waste, a plastic despair,
Leftover dreams and burdens we bear.
From food to trinkets, discarded with haste,
A silent chorus, our careless taste.
The Earth groans under this heavy load,
A future uncertain, a toxic road.
Will we learn to mend, or forever erode? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
