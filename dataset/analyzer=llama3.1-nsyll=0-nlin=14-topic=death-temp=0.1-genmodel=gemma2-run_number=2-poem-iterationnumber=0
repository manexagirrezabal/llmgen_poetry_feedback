A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
A mournful song beneath a leaden sky.
The body sleeps, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing bright,
And love's soft echo whispers in the night.
Though death may claim the form, the spirit flies,
To realms unknown, where truth forever lies.

So let us grieve not, but celebrate the soul,
That danced with life, and made our spirits whole.
