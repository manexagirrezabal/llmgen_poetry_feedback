 > assistant: Whispers of wind through the trees so tall,
A gentle breeze that rustles them all.
The sun shines bright with a warm ray,
Bringing life to the world in its own way.

The stars appear at night's dark face,
Twinkling diamonds in a celestial place.
The moon glows full with a silver light,
 Illuminating all, banishing the night.
 > human: Thank you!
