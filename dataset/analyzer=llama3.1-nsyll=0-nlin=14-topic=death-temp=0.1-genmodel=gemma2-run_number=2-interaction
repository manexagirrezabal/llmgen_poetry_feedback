 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
A mournful song beneath a leaden sky.
The body sleeps, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing bright,
And love's soft echo whispers in the night.
Though death may claim the form, the spirit flies,
To realms unknown, where truth forever lies.

So let us grieve not, but celebrate the soul,
That danced with life, and made our spirits whole. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the pulse, the beating of the heart,
Just silent stillness, playing its own part.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ended, put to life's behest.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
And love endures, though flesh and bone are gone.

Through misty veils, a spirit takes its flight,
To realms unseen, bathed in ethereal light.
The cycle turns, from birth to fading grace,
A timeless dance, in life's unending space.

So let us mourn not, but celebrate the soul,
That touched our lives, and made us truly whole. 




 > human: Thank you!
