 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets as the breeze imbues
Each branch with gentle motion, light and fair.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As wildflowers dance in vibrant tapestry,
And butterflies on painted wings do fleet,
From bloom to bloom, a joyful reverie.

The scent of pine and earth, a calming balm,
Invites the soul to rest, to find its peace,
Where worries fade and spirits feel no harm,
In nature's embrace, where troubles cease.

A canvas vast, with beauty ever new,
A timeless wonder, forever fresh and true. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
