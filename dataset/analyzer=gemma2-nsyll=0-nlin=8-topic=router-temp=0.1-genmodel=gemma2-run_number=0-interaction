 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift routine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens within our dream.

It guides the flow, a tireless, hidden guide,
Through networks vast, where information hides.
A gateway built of silicon and might,
The router hums, ensuring day and night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
