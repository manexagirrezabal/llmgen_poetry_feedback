A silent sentinel, a box of might,
It hums and whirls, both day and night.
The router stands, unseen, unheard,
Yet weaves a web where data's stirred.

From distant lands to screens nearby,
It bridges gaps beneath the sky.
Packets dance on currents bright,
Connecting worlds with digital light.

A humble hero, often overlooked,
Its purpose clear, its task well-booked.
To keep us linked, to bridge the space,
The router hums, a steady grace.
