 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, one and all.
Its leather worn, its seams so fine,
A trusted companion, always on time.

In morning rush, it's by our side,
As we navigate through life with pride.
With laptop packed, and papers neat,
It holds our hopes, and our daily treat.

Through meetings and deals, it's a constant friend,
A symbol of success, that never ends.
Its zippers creak, its handles do strain,
But still it stands, through every business rain.

In the evening, when work is done,
The briefcase waits, till morning's won.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
