The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so green,
A gentle breeze rustles through their scene.

The forest floor is soft and deep,
Where wildflowers bloom in secret sleep.
The river flows with a soothing sound,
As nature's beauty all around.
