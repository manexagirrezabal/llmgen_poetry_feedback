 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across distant lands
It navigates the web, with precision fine
Directing packets, in a digital line

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
A beacon calling, to devices that claim
Their place within the network's fold
As the router weaves, their connections to hold

In this digital age, it plays its part
A behind-the-scenes hero, with a gentle heart
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
