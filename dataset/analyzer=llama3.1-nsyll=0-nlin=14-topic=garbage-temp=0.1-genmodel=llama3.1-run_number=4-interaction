 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
A mountain high of trash resides.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste that's thrown away from you.

The earth cries out in sorrow deep,
As humans' carelessness does creep.
The air is thick with fumes so bright,
From landfills burning through the night.

The oceans choke on plastic's might,
A problem growing, day and night.
We must reduce, reuse, recycle too,
To save our planet, me and you.

But still we throw, without a care,
And suffer consequences we can't share.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
