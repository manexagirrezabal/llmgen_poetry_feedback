Trash cans overflow with yesterday's waste
 Forgotten wrappers and crumpled paper to replace
The streets are lined with litter, a sorry sight to see
Garbage trucks rumble by, collecting what's to be free
In the landfill, it's buried deep and wide
A toxic legacy that will not subside
A world of waste, where earth's beauty has died
