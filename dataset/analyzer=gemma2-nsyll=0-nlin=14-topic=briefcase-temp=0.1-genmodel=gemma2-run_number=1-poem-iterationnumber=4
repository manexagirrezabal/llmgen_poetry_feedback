A briefcase, worn and brown, a trusty guide,
Through bustling streets where fortunes can reside.
It holds ambitions, dreams both big and small,
And secrets whispered in boardrooms tall.

From dawn till dusk, it journeys by your side,
A silent partner on life's winding ride.
Within its depths, contracts are signed with care,
And plans are hatched beyond compare.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality profound,
As day gives way to night, and peace is found.
A symbol of progress, a tool for trade,
The briefcase waits, for fortunes yet unmade.
