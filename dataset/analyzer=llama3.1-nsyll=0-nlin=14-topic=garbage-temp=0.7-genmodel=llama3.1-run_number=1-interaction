 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twisted bags and discarded piles,
Garbage accumulates with stealthy smiles.
 Forgotten treasures lost to time,
Their worthlessness is hard to define.

The stench of rot and mold does rise,
As broken dreams and leftovers demise.
A landscape littered, soulless grey,
Where beauty once did bloom and sway.

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As plastic wraps and bottles grow.
In oceans deep, a darkened sea,
Garbage chokes the life from you and me.

We must reduce, reuse, and recycle too,
For a cleaner world, our future shines through.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about garbage that conveys an important message. If you have any other requests or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
