 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Golden light through leaves in gentle dews,
Whispers secrets as the shadows dare.

Flowers unfurl their petals, soft and bright,
Bees dance among them, humming sweet delight,
Butterflies on painted wings take flight,
Across a meadow bathed in fading light.

The river flows, a silver ribbon clear,
Reflecting stars that start to softly gleam,
A gentle breeze, a lullaby sincere,
As nature's canvas paints a tranquil dream.

Peace descends, a hush upon the land,
Nature's embrace, a solace close at hand. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊 🍂  Let me know if there's anything else I can create for you. 🌻
