A silent curtain falls, unseen, unheard,
And life's bright tapestry begins to fade.
The beating heart, once vibrant, stilled and blurred,
A final breath, a whispered serenade.

No longer bound by earthly chains we see,
We journey forth, beyond the veil of night,
To realms unknown, where souls forever flee,
And stars ignite with ethereal light.

Though tears may fall, and grief may hold its sway,
Remember love transcends the mortal sphere.
In memories held dear, we find our way,
Through echoes whispered, voices crystal clear.

Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever gleam.
