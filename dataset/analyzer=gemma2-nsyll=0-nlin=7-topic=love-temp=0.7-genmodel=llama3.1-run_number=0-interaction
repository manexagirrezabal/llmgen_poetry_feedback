 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be defined,
A bond between two souls intertwined.
With every touch, it grows with might,
Filling lives with joy and endless delight.
In love's pure light, our hearts take flight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something that resonates with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
