 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flicker in the night,
Two souls entwined, bathed in love's soft light.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A symphony of hearts, a rhythmic beat.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Love's tender embrace encompasses all.
It conquers fear, dissolves each doubt and pain,
A boundless ocean where true feelings reign.

With every sunrise, love's flame burns anew,
A promise whispered, forever strong and true.
In moments cherished, hand in loving hand,
Two lives united, on life's fertile land.

So let us celebrate this gift so rare,
Love's eternal magic, beyond compare.

 > assistant: A glance exchanged, a silent understanding,
Two hearts that beat in rhythm, hand in hand.
Love's gentle touch, a whisper softly landing,
A bond unbreakable, forever planned.

Through laughter shared and secrets gently told,
A tapestry of memories, stories unfold.
Like stars that shine in twilight's velvet sky,
Their love ignites, soaring ever high.

In every sunrise, hope anew is found,
Two souls entwined, on sacred ground.
With trust as anchor, fears begin to fade,
Love's tender promise, a future bravely made.

And as the years unfold, their love will stay,
A beacon burning bright, come what may.
