Sunlight spills on leaves of vibrant green,
A gentle breeze through branches softly keen.
Wildflowers bloom in colors bright and bold,
Butterflies dance, a story to be told.

Crystal streams meander, clear and free,
Reflecting skies where clouds drift lazily.
Ancient trees stand tall, their roots run deep,
Secrets whispered while the world does sleep.

Crimson sunsets blaze across the land,
As stars ignite, a celestial band.
Nature's canvas painted with such grace,
A masterpiece, time cannot erase.
