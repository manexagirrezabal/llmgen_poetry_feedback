 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight paints the leaves with gold,
A gentle breeze whispers untold.
Birdsong fills the air so sweet,
As wildflowers dance beneath our feet.
Crystal streams meander slow,
Through meadows where the green things grow.
Nature's beauty, a calming sight,
A symphony of day and night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ğŸŒ»
