Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be contained,
A force that drives us to give and gain.

With every touch, our love will grow,
In each other's arms, we find a home.
Through life's ups and downs, it stands the test,
Forever with you is where I am best.
