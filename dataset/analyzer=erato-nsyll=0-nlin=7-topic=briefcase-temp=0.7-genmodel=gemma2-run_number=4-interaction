 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, worn smooth and brown,
Holds secrets whispered in a town.
Contracts signed, dreams tucked inside,
Ambitions carried, hopes to confide.
Each click of latch, a measured sound,
Power held captive, tightly bound.
The briefcase walks, its owner's guide. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
