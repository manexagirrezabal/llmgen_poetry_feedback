 > assistant: Garbage piles high on the ground
A mountain of trash all around
From plastic to paper to glass so fine
It's a mess that's hard to define

The smell is foul, the sight is gray
As we toss and discard each day
No thought for tomorrow's plight
Just a careless disposal in the night
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
