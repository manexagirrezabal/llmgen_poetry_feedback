A briefcase, brown and worn, a trusted friend,
It holds the weight of dreams that never end.
Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Contracts signed, futures bathed in golden light.

From boardroom walls to bustling city streets,
It walks with purpose, where ambition meets.
A silent witness to triumphs and despair,
The briefcase carries burdens, light or rare.

Each click of latch, a whispered promise made,
Of goals achieved, and fortunes to be laid.
A symbol of success, a tool of trade,
It journeys onward, never to be swayed.
