A humble case of leather, worn and dark,
It holds within, ambitions leave their mark.
From dawn's first light to city's fading gleam,
It strides beside, a silent, trusted dream.

With every click, a promise takes its stand,
Of futures built, on deals throughout the land.
But closed at night, it speaks in hushed refrain,
Of battles fought, and victories attained.

A weathered map of triumphs yet to come,
A testament to journeys bravely won.
So raise a toast to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase strong, until life's very end.
