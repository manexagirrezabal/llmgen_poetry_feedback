 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter echoes, tears they share,
Through sunshine bright and stormy air.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
A bond unbreakable, forever heard.
In love's embrace, they find their bliss,
A symphony of hearts, sealed with a kiss. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
