 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather case, so sleek and fine,
For carrying files, a businessman's sign.
Documents and papers, all neatly stacked,
In the briefcase, his work is packed.

It travels with him, day in and out,
To meetings and deals, without a doubt.
The weight of responsibility it bears,
As he navigates the world with careful airs.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
