 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making connections known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
Data flows like rivers, swift and strong,
Through channels built where signals belong.

A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
To distant shores, where stories reside.
With every click, a journey takes flight,
The router guides us through the digital night.

A humble hero, often overlooked,
It keeps us linked, our world bespoke. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
