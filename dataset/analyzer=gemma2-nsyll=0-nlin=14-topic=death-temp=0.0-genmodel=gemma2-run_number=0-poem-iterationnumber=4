The final breath, a whisper soft and low,
A dimming light where vibrant colors flow.
No more the pulse that beat a steady drum,
Just silence reigns, where life had overcome.

A tapestry of moments, woven tight,
Now fades to gray, in fading candlelight.
But love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls through shadows, dark and bright.

Though flesh decays, and bones return to dust,
The spirit soars, on wings of hope and trust.
A journey starts, beyond the veil unseen,
Where stars ignite, and dreams forever glean.
