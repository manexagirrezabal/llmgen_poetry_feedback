The sun descends, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds with hues of pink and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through stories untold,
As shadows lengthen, secrets softly spread.

The birds return to nests, their day complete,
And crickets chirp a lullaby so sweet.
Stars begin to twinkle, diamonds in the night,
Guiding lost souls with their ethereal light.

A hush descends, a moment of repose,
Where weary minds find solace and release.
The moon ascends, her silver glow bestows
A tranquil peace upon the sleeping trees.

And in this stillness, dreams take flight and soar,
To realms unknown, beyond time's distant shore.
