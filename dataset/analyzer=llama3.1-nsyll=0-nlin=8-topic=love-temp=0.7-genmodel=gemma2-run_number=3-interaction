 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's gentle touch embraces all.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
A beacon guiding me to you.
In your embrace, I find my peace,
My heart forever yours to keep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š  I'm glad you liked the poem.  Is there anything else I can help you with?
