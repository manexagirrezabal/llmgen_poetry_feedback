 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
As shadows lengthen 'neath a fading sky.
The body rests, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing,
In hearts that hold them, love forever flowing.
Though flesh may fade and bones return to dust,
The spirit soars, on wings of hope and trust.

And in the silence, whispers softly rise,
"Life's not an ending, but a sweet sunrise." 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whisper on the breeze,
A fading light that softly disappears.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just quiet peace, where shadows gently come.

The world moves on, oblivious and bright,
While stars above reflect a somber night.
But in the stillness, memories take flight,
Of laughter shared, and love's enduring light.

A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now rests in silence, where all things entwine.
Though earthly bonds may break and spirits fly,
Love's echo lingers, reaching for the sky.

And though we grieve, a whisper fills the air:
"Life's not an ending, but a journey rare."

And stars ignite against the darkening sky.

Of moments shared, and love's enduring light.

A tapestry of dreams, now softly spun,
Where earthly threads are gently overcome.
Though bodies rest, and spirits take their flight,
Love's gentle echo lingers in the night.
