The briefcase sits, with stories untold
Its leather worn, its edges thin
A reflection of lives lived within

It holds the weight of daily strife
And secrets kept from morning light
A refuge for dreams, and plans laid bare
Where hopes and fears are shared with care

Its locks and keys, a puzzle to crack
Unraveling mysteries, one by one, back
The briefcase stands, through rain or shine
A constant presence, forever aligned

In meetings and deals, it's by your side
A trusted ally, where business resides
