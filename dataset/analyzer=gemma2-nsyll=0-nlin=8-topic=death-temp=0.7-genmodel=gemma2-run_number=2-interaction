 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A hush descends, the breath grows still,
The world retreats, a final chill.
A closing door, a fading light,
An endless sleep, through darkest night.
No whispered words, no mournful sound,
Just silent peace on hallowed ground.
A journey taken, swift and sure,
To realms unknown, forever pure. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? ðŸ˜Š  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
