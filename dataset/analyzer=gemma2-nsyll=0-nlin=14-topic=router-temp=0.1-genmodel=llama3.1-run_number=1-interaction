 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms so fine
Receiving and sending, in perfect time
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, to the digital thread

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
A beacon of access, for all to claim
In homes and offices, it's a constant friend
Helping us stay connected, till the very end

Through routers' magic, our world is made whole
A network of connections, that never grows old
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers to your liking. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
