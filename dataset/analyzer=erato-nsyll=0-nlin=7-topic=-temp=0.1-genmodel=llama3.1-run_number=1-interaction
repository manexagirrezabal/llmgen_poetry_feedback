 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As night's dark veil begins to rise
In this still hour, I find my peace
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
