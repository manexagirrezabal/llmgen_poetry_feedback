A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more applause, no laughter fills the air,
Just stillness deep, a weight beyond compare.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ends, a soul forever blessed.
But memories remain, like embers bright,
That flicker softly in the fading light.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's gentle touch will ease the mournful strain.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms we cannot yet explore.

And though we grieve, let hope our spirits guide,
To meet again, on that celestial tide.
