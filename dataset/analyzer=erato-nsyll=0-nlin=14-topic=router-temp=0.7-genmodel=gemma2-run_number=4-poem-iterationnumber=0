A silent sentinel, a box of might,
The router hums, a beacon in the night.
It weaves a web, unseen but ever strong,
Connecting worlds where data flows along.
From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It grants access to a digital land.
With packets sent and received with grace,
It bridges gaps, time and space it embraces.
A tireless worker, always on the go,
Ensuring streams of information flow.
But hidden deep within its plastic shell,
A symphony of circuits, stories tell.
Of bits and bytes, a language understood,
The router's magic, forever good.
