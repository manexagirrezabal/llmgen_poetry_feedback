The curtain falls, the final act is done,
A silent hush where laughter once had spun.
No vibrant hues, no beating heart's refrain,
Just empty space where life had held its reign.

The body sleeps, a journey now complete,
A whispered sigh, a soul set gently free.
But memories linger, like stars in night,
Guiding our steps, a beacon burning bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the day,
Love's gentle hand will lead us on our way.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar.

And though we part, our souls will ever meet,
In timeless love, forever bittersweet.
