 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent wings descend at night
Eternal rest, a final sight
A life once lived, now lost in time

The heartbeat stills, the soul does creep
Into the void, where shadows play
Where only silence holds its sway
