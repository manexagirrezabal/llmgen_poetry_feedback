 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, in corner it resides,
A web of wires, where data freely glides.
Connecting worlds, with unseen tendrils thin,
From distant screens, to voices whispered within.
It hums a tune, a gentle digital beat,
Guiding packets fast, down pathways concrete.
The router reigns, unseen, yet ever fleet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
