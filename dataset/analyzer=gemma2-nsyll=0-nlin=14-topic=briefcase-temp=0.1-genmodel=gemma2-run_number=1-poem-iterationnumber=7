A humble briefcase, worn and brown of hue,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams come true.
From bustling streets to boardrooms grand,
It carries burdens, close at hand.

Within its depths, ambition takes flight,
Deals struck with purpose, day and night.
A silent witness to triumphs and woes,
The briefcase travels wherever it goes.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality's sound,
Leaving behind the chaos it has found.
A symbol of progress, a tool refined,
In its embrace, fortunes are entwined.
