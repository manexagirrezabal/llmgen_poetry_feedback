In twisted heaps, it lies in sight
A mountain high of discarded might
Plastic and paper, glass and more
The byproducts of our daily score

It chokes the earth with its putrid smell
And fills the air with a toxic spell
We toss it carelessly, without a thought
Leaving behind a world that's been caught
