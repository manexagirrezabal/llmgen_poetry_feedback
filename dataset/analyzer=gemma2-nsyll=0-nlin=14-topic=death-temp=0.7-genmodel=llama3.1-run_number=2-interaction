 > assistant: Death's dark shadow falls on earth below
A silent thief that steals our mortal glow
It creeps in quiet, never to depart
Leaving behind a hollow, broken heart

 Memories of life, now but a fading light
Echoes of what once was, lost in endless night
The warmth of love, the sun's gentle rays
Frozen in time, as death's dark veil amazes

In death's cold grasp, we find our final rest
A fleeting moment, forever etched in breast
Our lives, a spark that flickers out to sea
Leaving behind only whispers of what used to be

Death's mysteries, we can never fully know
Yet, in its darkness, lies an eternal glow
