 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh,
A curtain falls, the stars on high
Observe a soul take flight and soar,
To realms unknown, forevermore.
No pain remains, no fear to hold,
Just peaceful rest, a story told.
In memories bright, our love endures,
Though mortal shells turn to dust, pure. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
