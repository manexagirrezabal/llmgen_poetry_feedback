 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets close, in hurried grasp.
From boardroom walls to city streets,
It carries dreams and anxious feats.
A silent witness, day by day,
To deals made, and fortunes sway.
The briefcase waits, its duty clear. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
