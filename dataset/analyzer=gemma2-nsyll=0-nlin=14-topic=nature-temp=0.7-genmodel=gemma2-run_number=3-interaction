 > assistant: The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves so bright,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to the trees,
And flowers bloom in hues of pure delight,
While buzzing bees their honeyed work appease.

A babbling brook flows clear and ever free,
Reflecting skies of azure blue above,
Where soaring birds sing melodies with glee,
And clouds like cotton drift on winds of love.

The rustling grass a soothing sound doth make,
As nature's symphony unfolds its grace,
A vibrant tapestry, for all to take,
And find within its beauty, time and space. 

So let us pause, and breathe the air so sweet,
In nature's embrace, our weary souls complete. 



 > human: Thank you!
