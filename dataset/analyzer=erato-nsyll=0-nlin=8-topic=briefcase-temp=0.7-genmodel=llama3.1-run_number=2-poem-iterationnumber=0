A symbol of success in leather so fine,
The briefcase holds secrets, and stories divine.
With clasps that snap shut, and zippers that glide,
It carries the weight of a professional's pride.

Inside its compartments, papers are neatly stacked,
Reports and proposals, with each page carefully packed.
A mobile office on wheels, it travels by one's side,
A trusted companion, through meetings and deadlines to abide.
