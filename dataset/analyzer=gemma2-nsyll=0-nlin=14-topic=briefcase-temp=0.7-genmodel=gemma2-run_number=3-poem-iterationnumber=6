A vessel crafted from the finest hide,
It bears the weight of futures yet to ride.
Through bustling streets and boardrooms cold and bright,
It walks beside, a beacon in the night.

With every clasp, ambition takes its hold,
Deals forged and dreams within its depths unfold.
But when it rests, a silent story lies,
Of battles fought, and victories that rise.

A weathered guide through triumphs yet to be,
The briefcase stands, a testament to thee.
So raise a glass to this enduring friend,
Whose steadfast form will journey without end.
