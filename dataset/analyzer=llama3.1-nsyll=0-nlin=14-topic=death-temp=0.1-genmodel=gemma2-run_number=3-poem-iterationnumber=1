The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A silent curtain falls upon our hearts.
No more the laughter, joy, or sorrow's sting,
Just empty echoes where life used to sing.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ends, a soul forever blessed.
But memories remain, like stars above,
To guide us through the darkness, and with love.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud our sight,
Hope's gentle beacon shines throughout the night.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A passage to a realm beyond our art.

And in that place, where shadows gently fade,
We'll meet again, no longer sad or frayed.
