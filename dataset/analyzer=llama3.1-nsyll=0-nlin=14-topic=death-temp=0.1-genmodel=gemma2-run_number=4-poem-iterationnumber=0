A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered branches sighs,
As shadows lengthen 'neath the fading skies.
The heart that beat with passion now is still,
And memories dance upon a distant hill.

But though the body sleeps in earthen bed,
The soul takes flight, on wings unseen, unsaid.
To realms unknown, where mysteries unfold,
A journey whispered, never to be told.

So fear not death, its touch both cold and kind,
For life's true essence lingers, left behind.
