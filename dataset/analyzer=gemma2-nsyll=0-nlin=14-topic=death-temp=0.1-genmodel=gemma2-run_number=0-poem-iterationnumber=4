The final breath, a feather on the breeze,
A silent sigh, as life surrenders ease.
No more the laughter, tears that once did fall,
Just empty echoes in the silent hall.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A tapestry of moments, now grown cold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits glide?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light.
