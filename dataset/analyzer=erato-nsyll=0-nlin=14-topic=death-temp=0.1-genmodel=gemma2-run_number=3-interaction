 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories linger, echoes in the mind,
Of love and loss, of joys we left behind.

Though darkness claims us, fear not the unknown,
For in that silence, seeds of spirit sown.
A transformation waits, beyond our sight,
Where stars ignite and souls take endless flight.

So let us live with purpose, bold and free,
And greet the final curtain, serenely. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
