The whisper comes, a gentle breeze so light,
A touch of stillness in the fading day.
It steals the warmth, then shrouds the world in night,
And bids farewell to life's insistent sway.

No more the sunbeams dance upon the ground,
No birdsong fills the air with melodies.
A silence falls, profound and all around,
Where vibrant hues surrender to the seas
Of shadows deep. The heart that beat so strong
Now rests in peace, its rhythm hushed and slow.
The soul departs, where it has always longed,
To realms unknown, where mysteries will grow.

Though tears may fall, and grief may fill the air,
Remember love transcends all death can bear.
