 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Lies trash that's discarded with pride.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans recklessly let it grow.
From food to paper, to metal high,
It all ends up in the garbage sky.

The smell is foul, a putrid stench,
That clings to clothes and makes us wince.
But still we throw, without a care,
And leave the mess for others to share.

In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
A toxic legacy, a blight on our sight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
