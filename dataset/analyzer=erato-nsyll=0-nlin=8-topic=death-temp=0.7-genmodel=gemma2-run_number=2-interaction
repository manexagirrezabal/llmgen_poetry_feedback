 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a breath withdrawn,
The final curtain, gently drawn.
A silent sleep, a peaceful rest,
From earthly burdens, truly blessed.
No more the pain, no more the fear,
Just endless calm, forever near.
A journey made to lands unknown,
Where life's bright tapestry is sown. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
