Your smile, a sunrise, chasing night away,
A warmth that spreads, illuminating my day.
Your voice, a melody, so sweet and clear,
Whispers of love, banishing all fear.

With every glance, my heart skips a beat,
Drawn to your essence, both gentle and sweet.
We walk hand in hand, through fields of gold,
A story unfolding, yet to be told.

Two souls entwined, a bond unbreakable,
Our love a beacon, forever unshakable.
Through life's adventures, we'll stand side by side,
A constant presence, my loving guide.
