 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of data, where signals abide
It connects the world, with wires so fine
And brings the internet, to every home in line

With Wi-Fi waves, it reaches far and wide
Connecting devices, side by side
A router's work, is never done or slow
 Constantly serving, as the network grows
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
