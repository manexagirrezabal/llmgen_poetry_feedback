 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell, of leather brown,
Holds secrets close, within its crown.
Papers whisper, deals untold,
Ambitions packed, both new and old.
Across the street, a hurried stride,
The briefcase swings, with purpose tied,
To dreams pursued, and futures bright. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
