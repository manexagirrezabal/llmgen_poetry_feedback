A leather briefcase, worn and old
Carries secrets, stories untold
Its pockets filled with papers and stress
A symbol of work, and constant mess

It's carried by hands, that are strong and keen
Through streets and offices, it's often seen
A trusted companion, through every day
A faithful friend, in a busy way
