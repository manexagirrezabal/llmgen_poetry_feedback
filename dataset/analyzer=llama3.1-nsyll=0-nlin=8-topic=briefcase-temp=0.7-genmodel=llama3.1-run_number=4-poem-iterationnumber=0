A leather-bound case, so sturdy and strong
Holding papers, pens, and office song
The daily commute, it's a familiar sight
With briefcase in hand, ready for the fight

It carries weight of deadlines and stress
A symbol of power, or so we guess
But often empty, with nothing to show
Just an accessory, as the day goes slow
