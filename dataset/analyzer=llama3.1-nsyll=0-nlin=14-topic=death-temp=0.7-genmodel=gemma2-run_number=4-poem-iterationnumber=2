The final breath, a silent, whispered sigh,
Life's vibrant flame extinguished in the sky.
A journey starts beyond the earthly shore,
Where souls find solace and forevermore.

Though grief may linger, love will ever stay,
A guiding light to lead us on our way.
In memories cherished, hearts forever bind,
To those we've lost, a solace we can find.

Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever glean.
No longer bound by time's relentless hold,
In slumber deep, our stories will unfold.
