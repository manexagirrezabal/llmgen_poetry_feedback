 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase worn and old
Contains the tools of stories untold
Its leather cracked with age and time
It holds the weight of dreams that climb
The handle worn from many a hand
It carries secrets to distant lands
A symbol of success in its design
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
