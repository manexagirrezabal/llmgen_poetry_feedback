The final breath, a whisper in the air,
A dimming light, a silence beyond compare.
The body stills, its vibrant dance complete,
And weary soul ascends to realms unseen.

No more the laughter, no familiar sound,
Just solemn hush where memories abound.
Yet life's imprint etched upon the heart,
A tapestry of moments, set apart.

Though tears may flow, and sorrow fill the space,
Love's gentle touch leaves comfort in its trace.
For death is but a doorway, leading on,
To realms unknown, where spirits journey on.
