A fortress of leather, sleek and brown,
The briefcase stands, its secrets tightly bound.
Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Dreams woven tight, both dark and shining bright.

From boardroom battles to a quiet cafe,
It walks beside us through the winding day.
Contracts signed, decisions made with haste,
A silent witness to the human race.

A symbol etched in metal, strong and bold,
The briefcase carries stories yet untold.
Through triumphs won and losses hard-fought fair,
It stands with us, a constant presence there.
