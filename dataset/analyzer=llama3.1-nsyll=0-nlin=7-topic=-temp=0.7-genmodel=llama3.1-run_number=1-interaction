 > assistant: Silent moonlight shines so bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and darkness fill each space
The wind whispers secrets through the trees
As the night air brings a gentle breeze
In this stillness, I find my peace
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
