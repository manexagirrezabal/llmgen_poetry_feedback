 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and secrets kept,
Through storms they weather, gently swept.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
Love's tender touch, forever new.
In every glance, a silent vow,
Together they stand, here and now. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
