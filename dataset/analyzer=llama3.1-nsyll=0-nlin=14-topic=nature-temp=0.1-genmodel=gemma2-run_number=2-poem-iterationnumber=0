The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap 'neath the willow's shade,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And nature's symphony is gently played.

The moon ascends, a pearl in velvet night,
Stars twinkle bright, like diamonds scattered wide,
A tapestry of wonder, pure and light,
Where peace descends, and weary souls can hide.

In nature's embrace, we find solace deep,
A sanctuary where our spirits sleep.
