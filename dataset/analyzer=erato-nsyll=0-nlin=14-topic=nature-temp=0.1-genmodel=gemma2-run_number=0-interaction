 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where birdsong fades and twilight softly brews,
And shadows lengthen, secrets yet unseen.

A silver stream reflects the fading light,
While fireflies ignite in starry skies,
And crickets chirp their melodies all night,
As nature's symphony gently sighs.

The moon ascends, a beacon in the dark,
Guiding lost souls with its ethereal glow,
And slumber falls upon the sleeping bark,
Where dreams of wildflowers softly grow.

In stillness deep, a world renewed takes hold,
A tapestry of beauty, to behold. 



 > human: Thank you!
