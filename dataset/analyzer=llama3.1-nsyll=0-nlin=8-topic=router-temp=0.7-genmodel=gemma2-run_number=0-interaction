 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands so small,
Yet weaves a web that conquers one and all.
Through cables spun and wireless waves unseen,
It guides our data, keeping us serene.
From distant servers to our screens alight,
The router toils through day and darkest night.
A modern marvel, often taken for granted,
But without its magic, worlds would be uncharted. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ğŸ˜Š  

Let me know if you have any other creative requests. I enjoy helping with poems, stories, or even just brainstorming ideas.  âœ¨
