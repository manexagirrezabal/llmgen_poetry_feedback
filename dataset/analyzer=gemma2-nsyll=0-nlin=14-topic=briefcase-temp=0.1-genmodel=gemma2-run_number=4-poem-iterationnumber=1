A leather shell, a sturdy frame,
It holds ambitions, whispers fame.
Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of paper dreams and stories told.

From boardroom battles to coffee's steam,
It travels with you, a constant beam.
A silent witness, strong and true,
To deals made, hopes renewed.

A symbol of power, or just a guide?
A burden carried, side by side.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so tall,
A faithful companion, answering your call.

So open the clasp, let secrets fly,
From the briefcase's heart, beneath the sky.
