 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Softly glows the flame of love's pure light
A warmth that touches heart and soul tonight
In tender moments, it gently grows
A gentle breeze that only true hearts know
It whispers secrets in a lover's ear
And fills the space with hope and cheer
Filling life with joy beyond compare
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create something sweet for you. If you'd like another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
