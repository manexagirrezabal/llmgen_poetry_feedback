 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and cans, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature's light gives way.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and torn, forgotten and lost.
Food scraps and remnants, a sorry sight,
A testament to appetites at any cost.

The stench of decay hangs heavy in air,
A reminder of choices we make each day.
Can we not mend this burden we bear?
Find ways to lessen the waste on display?

Let's turn the tide, with conscious intent,
And build a future where trash is heaven-sent. 



 > human: Thank you!
