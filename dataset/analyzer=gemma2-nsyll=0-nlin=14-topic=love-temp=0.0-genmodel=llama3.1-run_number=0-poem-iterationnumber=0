Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
It's a bond between two souls, so strong and free,
A connection that's meant to be.

Love is a journey through life's joys and strife,
Through laughter and tears, it stands as a life.
It's the whispered words in the dead of night,
The gentle caress that feels just right.

In love's pure light, all else fades away,
Leaving only the beauty of each new day.
