The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
And birdsong fades as twilight softly brews,
A symphony of nature, seldom seen.

Tall trees stand guard, their branches reaching high,
To touch the stars that begin to appear,
While fireflies dance, a twinkling lullaby,
Dispelling shadows, banishing all fear.

The moon ascends, a silver orb so bright,
Casting its glow on meadows bathed in dew,
A silent world where dreams take flight,
And nature's beauty whispers, pure and true.

So let us pause, and breathe the air so sweet,
In this embrace of wonder, calm and complete.
