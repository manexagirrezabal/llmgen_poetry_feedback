Sunlight dapples through leaves of emerald hue,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets anew.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant array,
Butterflies dance where colors hold sway.

Crystal streams meander, reflecting the sky,
As clouds drift by, on breezes that sigh.
Ancient trees stand guard, their branches entwined,
Whispering tales of a timeless kind.

Crimson sunsets paint the western scene,
Stars ignite, a celestial sheen.
Nature's tapestry, woven with grace,
A symphony of beauty, time cannot erase.
