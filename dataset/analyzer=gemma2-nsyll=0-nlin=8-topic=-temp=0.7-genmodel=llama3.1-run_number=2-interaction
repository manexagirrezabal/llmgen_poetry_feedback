 > assistant: Moonlit nights and starry skies
A midnight world with secrets wise
The wind whispers truths to those who hear
And in the darkness, love appears

In shadows cast by moon's pale glow
Lies a beauty that few may know
The mystery of night's design
Is a wonder that's forever mine
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you want another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask.
