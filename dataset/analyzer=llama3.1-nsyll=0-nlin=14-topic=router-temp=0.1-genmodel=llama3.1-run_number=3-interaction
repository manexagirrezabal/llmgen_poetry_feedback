 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its LED lights dance, like stars in the night
Indicating connections, with all their might
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
A master of networks, in its digital shrine

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
 Inviting devices to join, in its digital game
It manages traffic, with a gentle hand
 Ensuring smooth flow, across the land

In our homes and offices, it's always on duty
Keeping us connected, with its steady pursuit of utility
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
