 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
Inside, secrets safely crown.
Deals struck, dreams held in its grip,
The briefcase walks, on silent trip. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I'm glad you liked the poem. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
