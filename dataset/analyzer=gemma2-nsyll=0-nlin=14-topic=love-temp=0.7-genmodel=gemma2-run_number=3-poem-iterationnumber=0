A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two hearts entwined, a love that starts to flow.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A silent glance, a rhythm strong and fleet.

Through laughter shared and tears that fall like rain,
Their bond endures, a solace from all pain.
With every sunrise, love's embrace anew,
A tapestry of dreams, forever true.

In darkest nights, their light will guide the way,
A beacon bright, illuminating day.
For love transcends the boundaries of time,
An endless journey, eternally sublime.

Two souls as one, a masterpiece divine.
