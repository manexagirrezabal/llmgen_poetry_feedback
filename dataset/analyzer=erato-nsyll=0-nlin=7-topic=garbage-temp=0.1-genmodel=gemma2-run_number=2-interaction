 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A silent testament to what's been made.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A future choked by what has been.
Will beauty rise from this refuse heap? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
