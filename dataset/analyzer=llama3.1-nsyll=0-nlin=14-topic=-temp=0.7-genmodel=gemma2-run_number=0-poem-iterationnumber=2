The twilight whispers secrets to the breeze,
As golden hues paint clouds across the sky.
A symphony of crickets fills the trees,
And fireflies ignite, their sparks fly high.

The moon ascends, a pearl upon the night,
Her gentle glow illuminates the way.
Stars twinkle softly, diamonds burning bright,
Guiding lost souls towards a brighter day.

A hush descends, a stillness in the air,
As nature rests beneath the velvet cloak.
And dreams take flight, beyond all earthly care,
In slumber's embrace, where wonders gently spoke.


The world is hushed, yet beauty fills each scene,
A tapestry of wonder, ever green.
