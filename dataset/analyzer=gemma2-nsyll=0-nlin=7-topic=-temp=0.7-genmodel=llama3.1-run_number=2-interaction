 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlit waves caress the shore,
A soothing melody evermore.
The stars up high, a twinkling show,
Dance and sparkle, as the night grows low.

As darkness reigns, its vigil keep.
In stillness, beauty finds its home.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something poetic for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
