Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that cannot be tamed,
A passion that forever remains.

With every touch, it grows more strong,
A bond between two souls, all day long.
In love's pure light, our hearts entwine,
Together forever, a love divine.

Through laughter and tears, we stand as one,
Our love shines brighter with each passing sun.
It's a journey through life, hand in hand,
With every step, our love expands.

In love's sweet refuge, we find our peace,
A haven where our hearts can release.
