In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land

With whispered words, he seals the fate
Of those who live, and those who wait
Their final breath, a fleeting sigh
As life's last spark, begins to die

In darkness deep, where none can see
Death's mystery, is revealed to me
A somber truth, that we must face
And find our peace, in a quiet place

Where love remains, and memories stay
And death's dark veil, fades away
