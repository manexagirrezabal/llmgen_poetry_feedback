The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the pulse that beat a steady drum,
Just silence reigns, where life had overcome.

A tapestry of moments, woven tight,
Now fades to gray, in fading candlelight.
But love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls through shadows, dark and bright.

Though flesh decays, and bones return to dust,
The spirit soars, on wings of hope and trust.
A journey starts, beyond the veil unseen,
Where dreams take flight, and all is evergreen.

And though we grieve, for those who've passed away,
Their memory lives, in hearts that love will stay.
