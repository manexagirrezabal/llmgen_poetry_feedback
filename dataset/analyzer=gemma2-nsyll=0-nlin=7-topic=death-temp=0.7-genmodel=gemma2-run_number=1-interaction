 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A breath that stills, a heart grown cold,
The final curtain softly folds.
A journey taken, swift and sure,
To realms unknown, forever pure.
No sorrow lingers, pain erased,
In silent slumber, gently graced.
A whisper fades, a soul set free.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
