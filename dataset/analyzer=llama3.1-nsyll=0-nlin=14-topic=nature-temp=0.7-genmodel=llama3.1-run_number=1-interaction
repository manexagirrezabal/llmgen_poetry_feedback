 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
As gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting clouds in rippled sleep.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks hidden in misty light.

In forest dark, the creatures roam,
Their nocturnal songs an eerie tone.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
A celestial show on this peaceful night.

The world is full of beauty and might,
A treasure trove that's always in sight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that you enjoyed. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
