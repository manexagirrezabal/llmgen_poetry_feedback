In silicon halls, a hero resides
The router's might, our internet guides
A bridge of bits, it weaves with care
Connecting all, beyond compare

Its processors hum, a gentle song
As packets flow, where they belong
Through wires twisted, or wireless air
It finds the path, without a single care

With IP addresses, and MAC so fine
The router navigates, in digital design
A traffic cop, of the online road
Directing data, to where it's bestowed

In our homes, offices, or public space
The router's role, is an indispensable pace
