The sun dips low, a fiery ball of red,
Painting the clouds with hues that softly spread.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
As twilight's embrace brings a tranquil scene.

Stars begin to glimmer, diamonds in the night,
Guiding lost souls with their ethereal light.
The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting shadows that dance and gently sigh.

Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
While weary world prepares for slumber's sleep.
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
A lullaby of nature, beyond compare.

And in this stillness, peace begins to bloom,
Beneath the watchful gaze of the moonlit room.
