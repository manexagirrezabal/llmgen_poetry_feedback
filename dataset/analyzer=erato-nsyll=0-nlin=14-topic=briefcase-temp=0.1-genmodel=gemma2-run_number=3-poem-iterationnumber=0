A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans entwined.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that can't be bought,
And futures built on fragile trust embraced.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks the path of progress, day by day.
A symbol of ambition, hard-earned feats,
A constant companion on life's winding way.

So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase, where stories never end.
