 > assistant: In twisted heaps, it piles so high
A mountain range of discarded sighs

Discarded dreams, lost in the night
The stench of rot, a foul decay
A reflection of our careless way
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
