 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting one and all.
Through wires thin or waves that fly unseen,
It weaves a web where data flows between.
From distant lands to screens within our grasp,
It bridges gaps, a digital clasp.
A modern marvel, humble in its might,
Guiding bits and bytes through day and night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
