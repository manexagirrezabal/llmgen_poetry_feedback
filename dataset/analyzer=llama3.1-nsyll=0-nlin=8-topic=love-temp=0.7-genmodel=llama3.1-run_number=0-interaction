 > assistant: Soft whispers in the dead of night
A gentle touch that sets my soul alight
In your eyes, my heart finds a home
With you, I am never alone

Your love is a flame that burns so bright
Warming my heart and lighting up the night
It guides me through life's joys and fears
Forever with you, my love wipes away all tears
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
