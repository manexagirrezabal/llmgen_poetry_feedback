 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and shadows fill the space

The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As darkness reigns, and light says goodbye
In this still hour, I find my peace
And let the world's wild noise release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
