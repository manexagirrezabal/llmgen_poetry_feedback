 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.

While styrofoam mountains creep.
A silent stench, a buzzing fly,
The earth groans 'neath this heavy sigh.
Oh, garbage, what have we become? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing prompt! 🖋️✨
