The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
A gentle breeze rustles through the night.

The stars appear like diamonds rare,
A canopy of twinkling light to share.
The world is hushed in quiet sleep,
Nature's beauty, my soul does keep.
