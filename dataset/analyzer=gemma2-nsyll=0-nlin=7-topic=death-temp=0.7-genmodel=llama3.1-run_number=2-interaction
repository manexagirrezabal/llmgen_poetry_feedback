 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness falls at night
A peaceful end to mortal sight
Death's cold wind whispers low and slow
A gentle release from life's dark woe
The heart that beats no longer free
In stillness lies eternity
Forever lost in endless sea
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
