 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness falls the final sleep,
A silence that the living keep.
The breath is still, the heart is cold,
The soul departs, its story old.

 Memories linger, echoes remain,
Of love and life, of joy and pain.
Death's mystery we can't define,
A fleeting end to mortal time.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
