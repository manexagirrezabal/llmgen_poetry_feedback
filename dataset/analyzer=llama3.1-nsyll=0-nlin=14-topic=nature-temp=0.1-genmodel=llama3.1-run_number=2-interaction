 > assistant: The forest whispers secrets deep,
Where ancient trees their vigil keep.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle hush,
As sunbeams filter through the rush.

A brook babbles on its winding way,
Through hills and valleys, night and day.
Its source unknown, yet flowing free,
It quenches thirst in wild ecstasy.

The mountains stand, majestic high,
Their peaks touched by the clouds' soft sigh.
The wind whispers secrets to their face,
And echoes back in a gentle pace.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace.

A sense of calm that time won't release.
