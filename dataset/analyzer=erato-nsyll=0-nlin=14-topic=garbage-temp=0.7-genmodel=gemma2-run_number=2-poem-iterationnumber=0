A mountain of refuse, piled high and vast,
A testament to consumption's hold.
Plastic and paper, remnants that won't last,
Stories untold in this discarded fold.

Food scraps decay, a pungent, earthy scent,
While metal gleams, once tools of daily grace.
Glass shards shimmer, where beauty was intent,
Now broken dreams, scattered without a trace.

A symphony of clanging, rustling sound,
As creatures scavenge, seeking what's in store.
The earth groans under this weight profound,
A silent plea for less and to explore

Sustainable paths, where waste finds its due,
And nature breathes freely, cleansed and anew.
