A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, its domain serene.
Through plastic shell, a pulse begins to flow,
Connecting worlds, both near and far below.

Packets dance, across the ether's stream,
A symphony of bits, a digital dream.
From distant lands, to screens that brightly glow,
Information flows, where knowledge can grow.

With steady hum, it guards the network's core,
Directing traffic, to each open door.
A guardian angel, in the tech-filled night,
Guiding our steps, with digital light.

So raise a glass, to this humble device,
The router's magic, keeps our world alive.
