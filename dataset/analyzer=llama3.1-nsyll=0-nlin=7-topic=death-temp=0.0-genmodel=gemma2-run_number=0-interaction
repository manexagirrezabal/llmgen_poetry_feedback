 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a whispered past.
No more the sun's warm, golden grace,
No laughter echoes in this place.
Just shadows dance and memories fade,
A life well-lived, a story made.
In slumber deep, the soul takes flight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
