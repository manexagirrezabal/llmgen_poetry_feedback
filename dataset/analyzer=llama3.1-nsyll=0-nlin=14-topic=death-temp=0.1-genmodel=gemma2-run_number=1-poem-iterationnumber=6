The final breath, a whisper on the air,
A fading light, a silent, solemn prayer.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just quiet peace where shadows gently come.

The world moves on, oblivious and bright,
While stars above reflect a somber night.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
Of laughter shared, and love's enduring run.

A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now rests in silence, where all things entwine.
Though earthly bonds may break and spirits fly,
Love's echo lingers, reaching for the sky.
