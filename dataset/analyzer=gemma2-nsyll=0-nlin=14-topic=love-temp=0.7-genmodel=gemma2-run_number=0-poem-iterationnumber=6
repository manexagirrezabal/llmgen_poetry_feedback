A whispered word, a touch so light and true,
Ignites a spark, a love forever new.
Two hearts entwined, a melody in time,
In love's sweet embrace, our spirits intertwine.

Through laughter shared, and tears that softly fall,
Love's gentle strength embraces one and all.
A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust we find,
Forever bound, two souls forever aligned.

With every glance, a promise whispered low,
Two destinies entwined, where love will grow.
In love's sweet haven, hearts discover peace,
A timeless journey, our souls released.
