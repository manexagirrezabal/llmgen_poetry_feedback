 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A final breath, a silent sigh,
The world fades out, as stars draw nigh.
No more to feel, no more to see,
Just endless sleep, eternally.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! 

I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š Is there anything else I can help you with?
