 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so green,
A gentle breeze rustles through their scene.
The river flows with waters bright,
Reflecting all in its quiet sight.
In nature's beauty, I find my peace.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
