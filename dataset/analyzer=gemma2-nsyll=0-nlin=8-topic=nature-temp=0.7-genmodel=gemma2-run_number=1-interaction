 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Green leaves unfurl in morning light,
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Sunbeams dance on petals bright,
And buzzing bees hum melodies.
Crystal streams meander to the sea,
Where wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's symphony, wild and free,
A sanctuary for me and you. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š   Let me know if there's anything else I can write for you. ğŸŒ»
