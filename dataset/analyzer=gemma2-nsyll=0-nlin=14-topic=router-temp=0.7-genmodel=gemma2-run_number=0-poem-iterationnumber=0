A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, data flowing keen.
Connecting worlds with every passing byte,
From distant shores to screens bathed in light.

Through walls and ceilings, signals take their flight,
A symphony of packets, day and night.
It knows no rest, this tireless, watchful soul,
Guiding whispers through its digital hole.

IP addresses, gateways open wide,
Sharing stories, secrets deep inside.
A humble box, yet power it displays,
Connecting lives in countless intricate ways.

So let us praise the router's unseen grace,
The bridge between worlds, in time and space.
