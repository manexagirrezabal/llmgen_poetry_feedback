 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silence, darkness claims its own,
A final breath, a life overthrown.
Memories linger, long after pain,
Echoes of love that will remain.
Death's cold grasp, it holds us tight,
And whispers softly through the night.
Fading light, eternal sleep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask.
