The sun descends, casting shadows long and deep,
A final sigh escapes, as secrets softly sleep.
The body stills, its vibrant dance complete,
A silent journey taken, bittersweet.

No more the laughter, no familiar embrace,
Just quiet whispers echoing through time and space.
Yet love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding the soul toward a celestial light.

Though tears may fall and hearts may ache with pain,
In death's embrace, peace gently will remain.
For life's a tapestry, woven thread by thread,
And even endings hold a beauty to be read.
