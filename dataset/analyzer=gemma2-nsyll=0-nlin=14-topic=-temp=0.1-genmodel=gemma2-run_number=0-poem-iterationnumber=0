The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon the velvet cloak of night.
Stars whisper secrets, soft and clear,
As shadows dance in flickering light.

A gentle breeze through branches sighs,
And carries scents of earth and bloom.
An owl's lament, a mournful prize,
Echoes through the silent gloom.

The world sleeps soundly, hushed and deep,
While dreams take flight on wings unseen.
A moment stolen, secrets to keep,
Before the dawn breaks, bright and keen.

And in this stillness, peace resides,
A sanctuary where hope abides.
