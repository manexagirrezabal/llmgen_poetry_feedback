The moonbeams dance on silvered waves tonight,
A symphony of whispers in the breeze.
Stars like diamonds scattered through the night,
Reflecting in the whispering willow trees.

A lonely owl calls out its mournful song,
As shadows stretch and lengthen in the dark.
A firefly's glow, a fleeting thing so strong,
Ignites a spark within a sleeping heart.

The world is hushed, a canvas pure and deep,
Where dreams take flight on wings of silver light.
And slumber claims the weary souls asleep,
Beneath the velvet cloak of starry night.

So close your eyes, and let your worries cease,
Find solace in the moon's ethereal peace.
