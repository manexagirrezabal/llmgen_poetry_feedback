 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Through thick and thin, they stand up tall.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
Love's melody, forever heard.
A bond unbreakable, pure and true,
Forever bound, me and you. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to explore any other creative writing ideas.  âœ¨
