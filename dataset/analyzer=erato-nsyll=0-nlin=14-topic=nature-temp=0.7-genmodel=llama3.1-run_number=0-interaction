 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Misty dawns upon the hills so green,
Where wildflowers bloom and trees are seen.
The forest whispers secrets in the breeze,
And ancient rivers flow with gentle ease.

In sunlit meadows, butterflies dance free,
Their colors shining like a symphony.
A gentle brook babbles, its voice so sweet,
As petals sway to rhythm of the heat.

Moonlight glows upon the mountain high,
 Casting shadows where the trees draw nigh.
The night's dark veil is lifted with each dawn,
And morning sunshine brings life back to form.

In this world full of wonder, we find peace,
A sense of calm that time cannot release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
