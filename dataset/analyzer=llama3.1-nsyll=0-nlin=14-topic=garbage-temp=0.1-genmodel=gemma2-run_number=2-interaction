 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, a symphony
Of clinking cans, where sunlight cannot sway.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid haze,
A testament to our insatiable greed.
We fill the earth with what we can't erase,
A legacy of waste, a poisoned seed.

But hope remains, a flicker in the night,
To mend our ways, to choose a different path.
Recycle, reuse, and hold the future tight,
Transforming trash into a vibrant aftermath.

Let's build a world where garbage finds its place,
A cleaner future, with a brighter grace. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 18 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic mountains rise, a choking tide,
Of wrappers, bottles, dreams cast aside.
A symphony of clinking cans resounds,
Where sunlight struggles, lost and unbound.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid haze,
A testament to our wasteful ways.
Forgotten treasures, now decay and rust,
A legacy of greed, turned into dust.

But hope remains, a fragile, flickering spark,
To mend our ways, leave our mark.
Recycle, reuse, let's turn the tide,
Transforming trash with conscious stride.

A cleaner future, within our grasp,
If we choose wisely, and make it last.
