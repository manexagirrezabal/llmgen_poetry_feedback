 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shield, a metal clasp,
It holds secrets, hopes, and tasks.
From boardroom wars to coffee chats,
It strides through cityscapes like that.
A silent witness, strong and sleek,
Across the miles, its owner's peak.
The briefcase waits, its journey deep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
