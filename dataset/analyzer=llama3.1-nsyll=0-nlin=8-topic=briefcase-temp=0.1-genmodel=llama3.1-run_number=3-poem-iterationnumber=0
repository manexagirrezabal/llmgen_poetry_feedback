A sleek and sturdy briefcase by my side,
Carrying secrets, documents to abide.
Its leather worn, its edges thin,
A trusted companion for work within.

It holds my papers, my laptop too,
My daily essentials, all neatly drew.
In meetings and conferences, it's always near,
A symbol of professionalism, year after year.
