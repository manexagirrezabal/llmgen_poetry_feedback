Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
In each other's arms, we've just begun.
The world may fade, but love will remain,
A constant heartbeat that forever sustains.

Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
A bond so strong that forever finds its best.
It's a whispered promise in the dead of night,
A gentle whisper that shines with all its might.

Love is a gift that we give to each other,
A treasure that we hold, a love that will weather.
