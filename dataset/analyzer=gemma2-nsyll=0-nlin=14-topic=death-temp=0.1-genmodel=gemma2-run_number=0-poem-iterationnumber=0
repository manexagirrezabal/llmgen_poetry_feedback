A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes in the morning dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life once lived, now memories unfold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits glide?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light.

Death's gentle touch, a mystery profound,
Where life and darkness intertwine and bound.
