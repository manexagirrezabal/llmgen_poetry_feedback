 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignited, a flame took hold,
Two souls entwined, a story untold.
Hearts beat as one, a symphony sweet,
A bond unbreakable, love's gentle heat.
Through laughter and tears, through sunshine and rain,
Love's tender embrace, easing every pain.
A promise whispered, forever to stay,
In this love's haven, where dreams hold sway. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! 😊  I'm glad you liked the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🎨🎶✍️
