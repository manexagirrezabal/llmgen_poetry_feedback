 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now trash sets free.
Forgotten wrappers, bottles tossed aside,
A silent testament to what we hide.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A future choked by what has been.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a legacy, clean and grand. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
