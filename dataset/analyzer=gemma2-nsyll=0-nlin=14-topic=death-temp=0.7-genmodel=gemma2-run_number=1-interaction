 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final curtain falls, a hush descends,
A silent breath, the journey at an end.
No more the laughter, tears, or fleeting joys,
Just empty echoes where life once deployed.

But is it truly darkness, cold and stark?
Or just a veil that hides a distant spark?
Perhaps a slumber, deep and undisturbed,
Where memories bloom, forever unblurred.

A whispered promise on the wind's soft sigh,
That love transcends, beyond the earthly sky.
So fear not death, its chilling, final call,
For in its embrace, we rise above it all.
And find a peace that knows no bounds or end. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 13 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The whisper comes, a gentle breeze so light,
A touch of stillness in the fading day.
It steals the warmth, then shrouds the world in night,
And bids farewell to life's insistent sway.

No more the sunbeams dance upon the ground,
No birdsong fills the air with melodies.
A silence falls, profound and all around,
Where vibrant hues surrender to the seas
Of shadows deep. The heart that beat so strong
Now rests in peace, its rhythm hushed and slow.
The soul departs, where it has always longed,
To realms unknown, where mysteries will grow.

Though tears may fall, and grief may fill the air,
Remember love transcends all death can bear. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
