Sunbeams paint the meadow, gold and green,
Where wildflowers dance in breezes light and free.
A symphony of birdsong fills the scene,
And buzzing bees hum melodies with glee.

Through ancient oaks, the sunlight softly streams,
Illuminating ferns and moss so deep.
A babbling brook whispers secrets in its dreams,
As gentle shadows slumber, hushed asleep.

The air is sweet with honeysuckle's scent,
While dragonflies on gossamer wings take flight.
Nature's embrace, a moment heaven-sent,
Where peace and beauty reign both day and night.
