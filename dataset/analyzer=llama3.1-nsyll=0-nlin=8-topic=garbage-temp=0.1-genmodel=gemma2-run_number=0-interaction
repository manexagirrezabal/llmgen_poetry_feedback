 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Bottles and cans, a tangled mess,
Forgotten treasures, put to the test.
The earth groans under its weight so vast,
A silent plea, a future overcast.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a legacy, clean and grand. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
