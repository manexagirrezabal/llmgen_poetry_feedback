 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Packets dance through wires, swift and bright,
Guiding data, day and through the night.
From distant screens to servers far away,
The router hums, ensuring every ray
Of information finds its destined way. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š
