 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic mountains, towering high,
Tin cans clinking 'neath a leaden sky.
Broken toys and paper strewn,
A feast for flies, beneath the moon.
Once held promise, now decay,
Whispers of lives that slipped away.
We throw it out, with careless hand,
A burden left upon the land. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  😊 Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic? 🌎🌸🔥
