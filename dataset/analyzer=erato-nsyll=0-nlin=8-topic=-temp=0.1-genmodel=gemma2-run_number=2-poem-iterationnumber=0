The moonbeams dance on silver streams,
A symphony of whispers in the breeze.
Stars ignite, celestial dreams,
And fireflies paint the silent trees.

A gentle owl calls from its perch above,
While crickets chirp a lullaby of peace.
The world is hushed, embraced by love,
As shadows lengthen, worries cease.
