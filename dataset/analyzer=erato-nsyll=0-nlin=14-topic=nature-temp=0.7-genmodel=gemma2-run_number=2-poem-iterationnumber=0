The sun dips low, a brushstroke on the sky,
Painting clouds with hues of gold and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves nearby,
As twilight's hush descends, a soft bed.

Green fields surrender to shadows long,
And crickets chirp their evening serenade.
The moon ascends, a silver, watchful throng,
Guiding fireflies in their starry raid.

Stars begin to pepper velvet night,
A symphony of silence fills the air.
Nature slumbers, bathed in gentle light,
Until the dawn dispels the darkness there.

A world renewed, awaits the morning's grace,
And life awakens in its peaceful space.
