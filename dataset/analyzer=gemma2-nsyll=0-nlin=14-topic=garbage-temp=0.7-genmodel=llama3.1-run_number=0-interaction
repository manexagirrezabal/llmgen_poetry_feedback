 > assistant: In streets and alleys, it's a sad sight
A pile of trash, with no end in sight
Food wrappers and bottles, a messy mess
The result of human carelessness, I must confess

From discarded plastic to torn up paper too
It all ends up here, what are we to do?
We throw away things that could still be used
And contribute to the earth's abused mood

In landfills deep, it's buried and stored
But the effects on our planet are forever implored
The stench of rotting garbage fills the air
A constant reminder of our careless snare

Our actions have consequences, we must see
And take responsibility for what we put out to be
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
