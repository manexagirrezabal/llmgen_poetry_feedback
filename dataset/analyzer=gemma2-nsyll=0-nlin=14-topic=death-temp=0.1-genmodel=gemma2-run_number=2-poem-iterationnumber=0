A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more applause, no laughter fills the air,
Just stillness deep, a weight beyond compare.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories linger, like embers in the night,
Warm glimmers dancing, casting gentle light.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's echo whispers, easing every strain.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms unknown, forevermore.

And though we grieve, and miss the ones we knew,
Their spirit lives within us, strong and true.
