 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
On velvet skies, where shadows leer.
A whisper sighs through rustling leaves,
As darkness dances, and silence weaves.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Illuminate the lonely night.
A world asleep, in slumber deep,
While secrets dance, and mysteries keep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.
