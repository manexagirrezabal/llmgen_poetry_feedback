A briefcase sits upon the floor,
Its leather worn, its edges sore.
It holds the weight of daily strife,
The papers, pens, and endless life.

Inside its depths, a story's told,
Of meetings, deals, and negotiations cold.
The rustle of papers, a sound so neat,
As one prepares to take on the street.

A symbol of power, or so it seems,
A status icon, or just a dream?
It follows us through trials and strife,
A constant companion, day and night's life.

Through airport terminals, and city streets,
The briefcase goes, with its owner's beats.
