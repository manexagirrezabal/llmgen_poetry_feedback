 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
As nature's symphony plays wild and carefree.

The breeze whispers secrets through the grass,
And in the forest, creatures pass.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
In harmony with all, they shine so bright.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create the poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
