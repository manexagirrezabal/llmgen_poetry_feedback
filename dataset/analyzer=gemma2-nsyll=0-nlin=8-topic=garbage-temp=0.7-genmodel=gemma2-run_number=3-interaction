 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where wrappers dance and bottles hide.
Aluminum cans in rusted heaps,
While broken glass in shadows sleeps.
The landfill grows, a hungry beast,
Devouring waste, from least to feast.
Oh, overflowing bins we see,
A testament to apathy. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
