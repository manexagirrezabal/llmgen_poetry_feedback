 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Death's dark shadow falls on mortal ground
A silent visitor, without a sound
It takes what's precious, leaving naught behind
A fleeting thought, a memory to find
In endless night, it claims its own
A final breath, a life overthrown
Eternal rest, or so we're told
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
