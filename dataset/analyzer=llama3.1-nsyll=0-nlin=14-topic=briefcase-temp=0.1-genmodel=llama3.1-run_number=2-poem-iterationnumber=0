A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase stands, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Carrying secrets, and business claims

It holds the weight of deals made new
And papers signed with promises true
A shield for documents, a keeper of trust
A trusted companion, in every bust

In meetings and boardrooms, it's by your side
A constant presence, as you take your stride
Through negotiations, and contracts so fine
The briefcase stands, a steadfast sign

Of professionalism, and business with care
It holds the keys to success, and shows you're aware
