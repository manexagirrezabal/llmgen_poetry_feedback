 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in sorrow deep,
As pollution spreads its creep.
We must take care, it's time to see,
The harm that garbage brings to you and me.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
