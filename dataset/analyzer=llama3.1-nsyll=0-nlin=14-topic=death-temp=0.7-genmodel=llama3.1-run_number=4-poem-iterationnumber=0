In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's whispered name sends souls away
A mysterious guest, unknown and cold
Stealing life from hearts that grow old

With silent steps, it glides unseen
A harbinger of fate unclean
It claims the young and worn with age
Leaving loved ones to turn the page

 Memories linger, a bittersweet refrain
Echoes of what can never be regained
The weight of loss, a grief so true
A sorrow that forever shines through

In darkness lies the final rest
Where mortal dreams are lost in death's nest
