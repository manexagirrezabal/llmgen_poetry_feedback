 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents, one and all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
It travels far, through city streets and night,
A trusted companion, always in sight.
Guarding its contents, a loyal friend indeed.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
