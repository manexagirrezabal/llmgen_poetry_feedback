 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, stories untold.
Laughter echoes, whispers soft,
Trust and tenderness, a gentle loft.
Hearts beat as one, a steady drum,
Love's symphony, forever to come.
In each embrace, eternity found. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
