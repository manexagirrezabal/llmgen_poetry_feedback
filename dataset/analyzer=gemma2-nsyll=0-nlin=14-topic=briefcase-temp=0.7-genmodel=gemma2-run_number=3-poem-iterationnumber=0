A sturdy shell, of leather dark and deep,
It holds the dreams, the schemes, the secrets kept.
Within its clasp, ambitions softly sleep,
And futures bright, with fortunes tightly swept.

From boardroom walls to bustling city streets,
It strides beside, a silent, trusted friend.
Through hurried steps, and meetings that entreat,
Its presence known, a power to extend.

But sometimes closed, it whispers tales untold,
Of burdens borne, and victories yet won.
A silent witness, brave and ever bold,
Beneath the weight of battles fought and done.

So raise a glass to this humble, trusty case,
A symbol strong, in life's relentless race.
