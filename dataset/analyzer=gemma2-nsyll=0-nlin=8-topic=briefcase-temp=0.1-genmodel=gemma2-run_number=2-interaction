 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and town.
Within its clasp, ambitions sleep,
And secrets whispered, dark and deep.
From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
It carries burdens, hopes, defeats.
A silent witness, ever near,
The briefcase whispers, "Time is here." 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
