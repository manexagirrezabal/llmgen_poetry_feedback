 > assistant: Moonlit nights that whisper low
Of secrets kept and stories told
The wind it howls like a mournful sigh
As darkness falls and daylight's gone dry

The stars up high in silver glow
A celestial show for all to know
Their twinkling lights like diamonds bright
Reflecting the beauty of the night

In this still hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm that world can't release
The world outside may be loud and bold
But here I am, where silence holds

And in the quiet, I find my way.

And a sense of wonder every day
