 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain, drawn at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm, golden ray,
No laughter shared, no words to say.
Just empty space where life once burned,
A whispered sigh, a lesson learned.
In darkness deep, the soul takes flight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
