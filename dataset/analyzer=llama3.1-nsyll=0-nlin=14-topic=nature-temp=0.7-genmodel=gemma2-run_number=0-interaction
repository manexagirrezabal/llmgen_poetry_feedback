 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight paints the leaves with gold and green,
A gentle breeze whispers through branches high.
Birdsong fills the air, a joyful scene,
As clouds drift by across the azure sky.

Flowers bloom in vibrant hues so bright,
Their petals dance in sunshine's warm embrace.
Butterflies take flight, a graceful sight,
Upon the wind, they flutter with such grace.

The babbling brook sings melodies serene,
Reflecting sunlight, shimmering and clear.
Nature's beauty, a timeless, calming scene,
Erasing worries, banishing all fear.

In this tranquil world, where peace resides,
Our souls find solace, nurtured and inspired.
