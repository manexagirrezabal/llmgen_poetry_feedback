In silicon halls, it quietly reigns
A hub of connections, hidden from pains
Routing packets with speed and with care
A behind-the-scenes hero, always aware

Its lights may flash, its sounds a hum
As data flows through it, one by one
It sorts and prioritizes with ease
Directing traffic with calculated breeze

A humble servant to our digital age
Keeping us connected in a world of stage
The router stands guard, day and night
Protecting our networks from cyber sight

In the background, it quietly works its might
Bringing the world to our fingertips bright
