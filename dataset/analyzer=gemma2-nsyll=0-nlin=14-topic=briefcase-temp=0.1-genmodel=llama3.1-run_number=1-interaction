 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather-bound and sturdy as can be
A holder of secrets, for you and me

It carries papers, files, and more
The weight of responsibility in store
A daily companion, through work and play
A trusted friend, that's always on the way

In meetings and conferences, it takes its place
A confident presence, with a steady face
But when the day is done, and it's time to go home
It's left behind, empty, all alone

Its contents scattered, its purpose undone
The briefcase waits, till the morning sun
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
