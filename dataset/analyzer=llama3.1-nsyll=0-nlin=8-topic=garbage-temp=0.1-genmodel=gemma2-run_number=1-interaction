 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles sadly hide.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A landfill's heart, a world betrayed.
We toss and turn, consume and waste,
Ignoring nature's fragile grace.
But mountains rise, a silent plea,
For mindful hands to set us free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
