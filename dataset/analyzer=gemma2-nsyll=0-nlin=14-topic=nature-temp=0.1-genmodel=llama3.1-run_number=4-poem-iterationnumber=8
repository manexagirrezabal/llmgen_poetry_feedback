The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks reaching high into the light.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its tranquil dream.

The forest floor, a carpet green and deep,
Where wildflowers bloom and creatures creep.
The scent of pine and earth fills the air,
Invigorating senses beyond compare.
In nature's splendor, I find my peace,
A sense of calm that never will cease.
