 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy case of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and renown.
From boardroom deals to coffee chats,
It carries secrets, maps, and facts.
A silent witness to each day,
As dreams are forged along the way.
The briefcase clasps, a final click,
And journeys start, both fast and quick. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š
