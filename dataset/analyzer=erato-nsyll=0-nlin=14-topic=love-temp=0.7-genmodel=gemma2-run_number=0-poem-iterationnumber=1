A single glance, a universe unveiled,
Two souls colliding, destinies hailed.
A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Love's tender story, waiting to unfold.

Laughter echoes, sweet melodies rise,
Sharing secrets beneath starlit skies.
Hands intertwined, a symphony of touch,
Whispers of longing, meaning so much.

Through life's meanderings, they stand as one,
A bond unbreakable, forever begun.
With every sunrise, love's embers glow,
Two hearts entwined, in a radiant flow.
