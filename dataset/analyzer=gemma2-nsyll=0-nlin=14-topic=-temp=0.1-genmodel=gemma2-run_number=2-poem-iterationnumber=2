The old oak stands, a sentinel of time,
Its branches reaching for the sun's warm climb.
Leaves whisper secrets on the gentle breeze,
A symphony of rustling through the trees.

Beneath its shade, a carpet green and deep,
Where wildflowers bloom and butterflies do leap.
A robin sings its melody so sweet,
As squirrels scamper, nimble at their feet.

The sun descends, casting golden rays,
Upon this haven where tranquility stays.
And as the twilight paints the sky with hues,
The oak stands silent, bathed in evening dews.
