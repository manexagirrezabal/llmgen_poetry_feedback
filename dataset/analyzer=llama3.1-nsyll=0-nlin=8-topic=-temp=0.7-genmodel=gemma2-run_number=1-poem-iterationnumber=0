The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon a velvet canvas dark and clear.
Stars whisper secrets, soft and low,
As shadows dance, where breezes flow.

A lonely owl calls, a mournful sound,
While crickets chirp, on hallowed ground.
The night unfolds, a mystic dream,
Where slumber reigns, and spirits gleam.
