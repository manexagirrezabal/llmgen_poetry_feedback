 > assistant: The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
Upon the hills, a golden mist.
Stars begin to softly gleam,
A hushed world, a waking dream.
The moon ascends, a silver guide,
Through velvet skies, where shadows hide.
And silence falls, a gentle sleep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
