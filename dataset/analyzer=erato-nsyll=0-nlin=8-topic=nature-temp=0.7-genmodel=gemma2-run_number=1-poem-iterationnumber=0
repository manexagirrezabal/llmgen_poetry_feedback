Green leaves unfurl in sun's warm grace,
A gentle breeze through branches race.
Birdsong fills the air so sweet,
As wildflowers bloom beneath our feet.

Crystal streams meander through the green,
A symphony of nature, a vibrant scene.
From towering trees to humble moss,
Life's tapestry unfolds, without a loss.
