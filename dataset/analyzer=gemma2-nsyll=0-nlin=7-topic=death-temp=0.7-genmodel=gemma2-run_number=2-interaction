 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A hush descends, the breath held tight,
A final flicker, fading light.
The body still, a silent sleep,
Where memories dance, secrets deep.
No longer bound by earthly ties,
A soul takes flight to starlit skies.
Death's gentle touch, a whispered rhyme. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it.  ğŸ˜Š
