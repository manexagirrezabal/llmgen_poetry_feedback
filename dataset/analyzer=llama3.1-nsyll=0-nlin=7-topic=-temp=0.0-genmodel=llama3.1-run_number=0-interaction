 > assistant: Silent stars shine in the midnight sky
A gentle breeze whispers secrets by
The world is hushed, a peaceful sight
As moonlight dances with the night
The trees stand tall, their branches sway
In harmony with nature's gentle way
In this stillness, I find my peace tonight
 > human: Thank you!
