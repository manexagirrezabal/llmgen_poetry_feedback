 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The forest whispers secrets low,
A gentle breeze that rustles slow.
The trees stand tall, their leaves so bright,
Dancing in sunlight's warm delight.

A brook babbles on, its voice so clear,
Reflecting beauty, year by year.
In nature's heart, a peaceful nest,
Where life and wonder forever rest.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you that captures the beauty of nature. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
