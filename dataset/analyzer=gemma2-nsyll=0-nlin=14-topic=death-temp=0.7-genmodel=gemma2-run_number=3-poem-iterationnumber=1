The reaper comes, a shadow in the night,
A silent touch, extinguishing the light.
No warning given, no farewells said,
Just stillness deep, where dreams are left for dead.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
Its vibrant pulse now stilled, its journey blessed.
But memories linger, whispers on the breeze,
Of laughter shared and moments meant to please.

Though tears may fall, and grief may hold us fast,
A gentle peace descends, shadows cast.
For in that sleep, a soul finds sweet release,
And journeys onward to a boundless peace.
