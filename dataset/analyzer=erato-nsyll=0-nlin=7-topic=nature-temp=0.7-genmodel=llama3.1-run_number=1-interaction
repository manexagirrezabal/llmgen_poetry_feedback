 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its peaceful dream.
Nature's splendor is a wondrous theme.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create something for you. If you want more poems or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
