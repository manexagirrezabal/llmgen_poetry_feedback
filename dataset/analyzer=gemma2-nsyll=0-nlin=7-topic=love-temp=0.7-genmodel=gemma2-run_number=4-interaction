 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's gentle touch embraces all.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
Forever bound, me and you.
In love's embrace, forever free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  

Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different theme?
