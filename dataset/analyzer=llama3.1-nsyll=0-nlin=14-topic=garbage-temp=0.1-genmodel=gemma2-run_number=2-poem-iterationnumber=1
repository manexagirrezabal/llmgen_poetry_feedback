Plastic mountains rise, a choking tide,
Of wrappers, bottles, dreams cast aside.
A symphony of clinking cans resounds,
Where sunlight struggles, lost and unbound.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid haze,
A testament to our wasteful ways.
Forgotten treasures, now decay and rust,
A legacy of greed, turned into dust.

But hope remains, a fragile, flickering spark,
To mend our ways, leave our mark.
Recycle, reuse, let's turn the tide,
Transforming trash with conscious stride.

A cleaner future, within our grasp,
If we choose wisely, and make it last.
