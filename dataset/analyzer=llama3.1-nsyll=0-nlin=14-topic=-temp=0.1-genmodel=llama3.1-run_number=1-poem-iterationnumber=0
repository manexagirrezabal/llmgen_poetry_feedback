Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The forest whispers secrets to the night
As stars above twinkle with gentle light

The world is hushed in quiet reverie
A time for dreams and mystery
The wind stirs softly through the trees so tall
And rustles leaves that whisper back at all

In this still hour, the heart can roam
Free from the noise of a busy home
Where worries fade like morning dew
And peace descends with a gentle hue

The night's dark veil is lifted high
Revealing beauty in the evening sky
