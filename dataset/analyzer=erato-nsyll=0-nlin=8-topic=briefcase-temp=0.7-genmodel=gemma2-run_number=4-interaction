 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Within it secrets, dreams amass.
From boardroom battles to quiet cafes,
It bears the weight of countless days.
Sharp angles hide a world within,
Where deals are struck and fates begin.
A silent witness, always near,
The briefcase whispers what's held dear.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š 

Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  I'm happy to help!
