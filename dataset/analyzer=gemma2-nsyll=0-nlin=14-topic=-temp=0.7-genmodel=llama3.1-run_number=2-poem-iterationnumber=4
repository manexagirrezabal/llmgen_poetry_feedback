Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful evening, twilight high.
The stars come out and night is still,
A time for dreams, a gentle will.

The world is hushed, a quiet sleep,
The moon's soft light begins to creep.
The shadows dance upon the wall,
As darkness falls, and all is small.

In this calm hour, I find my peace,
A sense of rest, my worries release.
The world slows down, its frantic pace,
And in its stillness, I find a space.

To breathe, to think, and let go free,
With peaceful thoughts, my soul is light.
