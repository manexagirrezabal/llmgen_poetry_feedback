 > assistant: A spark ignited, a flame took hold,
Two souls entwined, a story to be told.
Hearts beat in unison, a rhythmic sway,
Whispers of affection light up the day.

Tender glances, smiles that melt away,
Concerns and fears dissolve with every ray
Of sunshine shared, laughter's sweet refrain,
A bond unbreakable, through sun and rain.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand they roam,
Building a fortress, making love their home.
Trust and devotion, a tapestry they weave,
With threads of passion, they both believe.

Forever bound, their destinies align,
Love's enduring flame, forever to shine.

A spark ignites, weathering life's harsh storm.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
Finding solace in each other's embrace.

Laughter dances on the breeze, sweet and free,
Sharing dreams beneath a canopy.
Eyes that sparkle, reflecting love's pure flame,
Weaving memories, whispering each name.

Hand in hand they walk, through sunlit days,
And under starry skies, love softly plays.
A bond unyielding, steadfast and true,
A love that conquers, forever anew.

Through changing seasons, their hearts beat as one, 
Love's timeless melody has just begun.
