The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through rustling leaves,
The world inhales, breathes deep, as twilight brews,
And shadows lengthen, secrets they conceive.

A symphony of crickets fills the air,
While fireflies dance, like stars upon the ground,
A silver moon ascends, a silent prayer,
As nature slumbers, peace profound.

The scent of pine and damp earth fills the night,
A tapestry of stillness, soft and wide,
Where dreams take flight on wings of gentle light,
And worries fade, nowhere to hide.

In this embrace, where beauty softly reigns,
We find solace, healing nature's gains.
