In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered breath, a final sigh
And mortal life says goodbye

The heart that beat with love and fire
Now still, its pulse no longer dire
The eyes that shone like stars above
Grow dim, their light reduced to love

In darkness, death's cold hand is laid
Upon the earth where life was made
A fleeting thought, a moment's pause
And all is lost in endless cause

Yet in death's silence, peace is found
A stillness that wraps all around
The end of life, a new beginning's mound
