 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and stress,
As humans throw away with no finesse.
The consequences mount with each new day,
A world of trash, in a dismal way.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
