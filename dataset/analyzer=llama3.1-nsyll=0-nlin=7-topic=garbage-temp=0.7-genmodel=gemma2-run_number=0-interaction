 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A tangled mess of plastic, glass, and tin,
Forgotten wrappers, remnants of within.
Decaying fruit, cardboard boxes brown,
A silent testament to what's gone down.
Mountains rising, a landfill's grim embrace,
The earth choked by our wasteful pace.
Will beauty bloom where trash holds sway? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  </poem>
