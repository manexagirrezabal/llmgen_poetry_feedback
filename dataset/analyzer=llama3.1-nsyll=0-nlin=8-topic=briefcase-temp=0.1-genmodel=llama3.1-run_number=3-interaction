 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase by my side,
Carrying secrets, documents to abide.
Its leather worn, its edges thin,
A trusted companion for work within.

It holds my papers, my laptop too,
My daily essentials, all neatly drew.
In meetings and conferences, it's always near,
A symbol of professionalism, year after year.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
