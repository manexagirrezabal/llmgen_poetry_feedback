 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In digital halls of network fame,
A humble hero bears its name.

Directing data through day and night.

With protocols learned, it guides the way,
Through the internet's endless gray.
It connects us all, a vital part,
A behind-the-scenes work of art.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
