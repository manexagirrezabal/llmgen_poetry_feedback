 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And with it, our hearts are filled with pride.
For love is the anchor that holds us tight,
Guiding us through life's darkest nights.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you about love. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
