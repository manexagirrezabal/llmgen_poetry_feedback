A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of gold,
As autumn's touch paints stories yet untold.
A final breath escapes, a fading sigh,
The body sleeps beneath a starlit sky.

No more the laughter, no familiar tune,
Just quiet echoes in the silver moon.
But memories linger, like embers glowing bright,
Illuminating paths that led to endless light.

Though tears may fall and sorrow fills the air,
Love's gentle promise whispers, "Have no fear."
For death is but a doorway, leading on,
To realms unknown, where spirits journey on.
