 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Shadows creep, and darkness falls
A silent guest, who calls us all
To leave behind the light of day
And walk into an endless gray
Where memories linger, yet fade away
The final breath, a whispered sigh
In eternal sleep, we say goodbye
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
