The old clock ticks, a steady, rhythmic beat,
Marking time's passage, both bitter and sweet.
Sunlight streams through dusty window panes,
Illuminating memories, joys and pains.

A faded photograph, a smile long gone,
Whispers of laughter, carried on the dawn.
A worn-out book, its pages filled with tales,
Of heroes and villains, love that never fails.

The scent of lavender, a calming embrace,
Reminiscing moments, time cannot erase.
Each tick and tock, a story yet untold,
In this quiet room, where memories unfold.
