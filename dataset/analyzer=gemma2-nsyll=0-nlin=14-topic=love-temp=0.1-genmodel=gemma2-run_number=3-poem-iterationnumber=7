A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A spark ignites, dispelling all the gloom.
Two hearts entwined, a melody so sweet,
A symphony of love, a rhythmic beat.

With every touch, a fire starts to glow,
A tender flame that only love can know.
Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.

In quiet moments, whispers in the night,
Love's tender embrace, a beacon burning bright.
Forever bound, through sunshine and through rain,
Two souls as one, love's eternal reign. 
A bond unbreakable, forever to remain.
