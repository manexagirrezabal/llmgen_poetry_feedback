 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Lies trash that's discarded with pride.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans recklessly let it grow.
From food to paper, to metal high,
It all ends up, and meets its demise.

In landfills deep, where none can see,
It's buried underground, a sight to be.
But still we throw, without a care,
And watch as nature suffers there.

The consequences of our actions dire,
A world in waste, with no desire.
 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
