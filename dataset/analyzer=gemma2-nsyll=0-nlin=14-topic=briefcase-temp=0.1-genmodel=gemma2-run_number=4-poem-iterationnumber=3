A briefcase, brown and worn with time,
Holds secrets whispered, hopes sublime.
Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of contracts signed, and stories told.

From bustling streets to boardroom floors,
It carries burdens, opens doors.
A silent witness, ever near,
To triumphs won, and doubts held dear.

A symbol of ambition's drive,
A tool for progress, keeping alive
The dreams we chase, the goals we seek,
Within its clasp, our futures speak.
