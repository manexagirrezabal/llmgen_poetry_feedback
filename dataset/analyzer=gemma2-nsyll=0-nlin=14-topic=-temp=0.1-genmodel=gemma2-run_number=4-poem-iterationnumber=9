The old swing set creaks, a rusty refrain,
A melody of childhood, etched in memory's lane.
Sun-bleached paint peels, revealing faded hues,
Of laughter and joy, whispered through the blues.

Empty seats sway gently, in the summer breeze,
Echoing with voices, carried on the trees.
Sandcastle dreams lie buried, beneath the ground,
Where secrets of playtime forever resound.

A solitary bird sings, perched on a weathered bar,
A poignant reminder, of moments near and far.
The swing set stands silent, a sentinel of time,
Holding stories whispered, in its rusty rhyme.
