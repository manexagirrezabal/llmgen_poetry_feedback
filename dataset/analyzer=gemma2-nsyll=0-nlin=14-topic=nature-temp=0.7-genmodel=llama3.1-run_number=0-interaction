 > assistant: In forest depths, where ancient trees preside,
A gentle breeze whispers through the leaves with pride.
The sunbeams filter, dancing on the ground,
As morning dew glistens all around.

The birds awaken, their sweet songs unfold,
Echoing joy that young and old can hold.
The rustling brook, a melodic stream,
Gently flows by, its soothing melody's theme.

In fields of green, where wildflowers bloom and sway,
Their colors vibrant, on a sunny day.
A soft rain falls, refreshing earth and air,
Bringing new life to the world that's everywhere.

Nature's beauty is a treasure to behold,
Filling hearts with peace, young and old.
