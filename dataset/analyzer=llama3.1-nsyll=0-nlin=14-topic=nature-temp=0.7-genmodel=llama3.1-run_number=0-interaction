 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In forest depths where ancient trees preside,
A gentle brook babbles, side by side
With wildflowers blooming, petals bright,
Their colors dancing in morning light.

The sun ascends, its rays now bold,
Awakening life from slumber cold
The creatures stir, their songs take flight,
As nature's symphony begins to ignite.

The breeze rustles leaves, a soothing sound,
That calms the soul and lifts it round
In this serene world, all troubles fade,
And peace descends like a gentle shade.

The stars appear at night's dark stage,
A twinkling canvas of infinite range.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
