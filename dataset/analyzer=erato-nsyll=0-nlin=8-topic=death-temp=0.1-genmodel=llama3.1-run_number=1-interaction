 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land

With whispered words, he claims his own
And leads the soul to a secret throne
Where darkness reigns, and light does fade
And in its place, eternal sleep is made
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like more poems or have any specific requests, feel free to ask.
