 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and wrappers, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature's light gives way.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid smell,
As creatures scurry through this barren land.
Forgotten treasures, stories they tell,
Now buried deep, by careless human hand.

A silent plea from the earth below,
To mend our ways, to choose a different path.
Reduce, reuse, let kindness grow,
And leave behind a legacy of wrath.

For garbage's grip is strong and wide,
Unless we break free, with conscious stride. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
