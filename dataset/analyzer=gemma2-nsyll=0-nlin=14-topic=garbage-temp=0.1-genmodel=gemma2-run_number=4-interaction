 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes set free.
Tin cans and bottles, a symphony of waste,
Forgotten treasures, a future erased.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and broken, lost to the night.
Food scraps and remnants, a feast for decay,
A silent reminder of what we betray.

The earth groans beneath this burden so vast,
A testament to our greed that will last.
But hope flickers still, in a seed's gentle call,
To mend and rebuild, before it's too tall.

Let us choose wisely, with mindful intent,
And leave a legacy, not waste heaven-sent.

Where dreams are discarded and beauty erased.

Forgotten treasures, a future misplaced.
