 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful evening, twilight high.
Stars appear and night grows deep,
The world is hushed in quiet sleep.

Moonlight glows with gentle beam,
Shadows dance upon the dream.
Night's soft silence wraps around,
A soothing calm that's always found.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a peaceful poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
