The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,
A gentle breeze through branches weaves,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
While wildflowers bloom with vibrant flair.

A babbling brook, a crystal stream,
Reflects the sky, a tranquil dream.
Tall trees stand guard, their roots run deep,
Secrets whispered while shadows creep.

The scent of pine, the earthy smell,
Nature's embrace, a magic spell.
From dawn till dusk, a vibrant hue,
A canvas painted fresh and new. 
In every leaf, a story lies,
Beneath the boundless, azure skies.
