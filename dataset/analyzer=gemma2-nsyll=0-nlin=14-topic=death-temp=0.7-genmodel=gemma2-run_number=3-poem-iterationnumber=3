A fading light, a breath that slips away,
The final curtain falls on life's bright day.
A silent hush descends, where shadows play,
And memories linger, whispering to stay.

No more the heartbeat, no familiar sound,
Just stillness deep, where peace can be found.
The body rests, its journey now complete,
Released from earthly bonds, a soul set free.

Though tears may fall and grief may fill the air,
Love's gentle touch brings solace and repair.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A journey onward to a distant heart.
