A sturdy shell of leather, dark and bold,
It carries dreams, both new and stories old.
From bustling streets to halls of power grand,
It walks beside, a silent, trusted hand.

Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Deals forged in fire, bathed in office light.
But when it rests, a whisper soft and low,
Of victories won, and seeds that still will grow.

A weathered map of journeys yet to roam,
The briefcase stands, a testament to home.
So raise a glass to this enduring friend,
Whose steadfast form will journey without end.
