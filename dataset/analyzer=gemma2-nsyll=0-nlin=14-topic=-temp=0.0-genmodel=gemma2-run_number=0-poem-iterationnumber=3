A silver moon hangs in the velvet night,
Casting its glow on fields bathed in soft light.
Stars like diamonds scattered across the sky,
Twinkling secrets as the hours drift by.

The wind whispers tales through leaves so green,
A lullaby of nature, serene and keen.
An owl's soft hoot echoes through the trees,
While crickets chirp their melodies with ease.

Silence descends, a blanket deep and wide,
As dreams take flight on wings they cannot hide.
The world sleeps soundly, bathed in lunar grace,
A moment of peace in time and space.
