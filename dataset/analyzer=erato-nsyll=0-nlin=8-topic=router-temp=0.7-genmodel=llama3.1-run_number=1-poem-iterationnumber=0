A humble hero of the digital age,
The router connects us to a virtual stage.
With wires and Wi-Fi, it bridges far and wide,
Linking devices in a seamless tide.

Its processor humming, it directs the flow,
Of data packets that never seem to slow.
In unseen ways, it keeps our connections strong,
A silent sentinel of the digital throng.
