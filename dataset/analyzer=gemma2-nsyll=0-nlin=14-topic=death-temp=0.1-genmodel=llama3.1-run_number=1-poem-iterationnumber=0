In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As life's last breath slips by

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that danced, now old
 Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's eaves

In darkness, death's sweet peace is found
A release from pain, a world unbound
Yet, in its wake, a grief remains
A longing for what could not be gained

And though it comes, with sorrow's might
It brings an end to endless night.
