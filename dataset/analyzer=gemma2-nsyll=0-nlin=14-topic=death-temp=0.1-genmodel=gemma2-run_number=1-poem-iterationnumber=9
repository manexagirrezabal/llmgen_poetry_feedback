The final breath, a whispered sigh takes flight,
A dimming star, extinguished in the night.
No more the pulse, the rhythm of the day,
Just silent peace, where shadows gently sway.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
Of laughter shared, and battles bravely won.

Though darkness falls, and tears may softly fall,
Love's gentle echo lingers through it all.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That opens wide to realms we've longed before.
And spirits soar, on wings of light so free,
To find new life, eternally.
