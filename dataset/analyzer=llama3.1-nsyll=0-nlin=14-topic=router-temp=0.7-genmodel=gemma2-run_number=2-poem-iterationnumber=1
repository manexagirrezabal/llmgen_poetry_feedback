A silent sentinel, a box of might,
The router hums, day and through the night.
It weaves a web, invisible and wide,
Connecting homes where dreams reside.

Through wires thin, and waves that soar,
Information flows, forevermore.
From streaming shows to emails sent,
Its tireless work, on us is spent.

A digital bridge, a modern art,
Connecting souls, playing its part.
No longer bound by distance's hold,
The router's magic, stories told.

A vital pulse, a steady stream,
Keeping us linked, in life's grand scheme.
