 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever understand.

No words are needed, feelings run so deep,
A love that's timeless, promises to keep.
In every glance, a universe untold,
A story written, in hearts of purest gold.

Forever bound, by destiny's embrace,
Love's gentle magic, time cannot erase.

A gentle touch, a spark that sets aflame,

In every sunrise, a promise to embrace,
A tapestry of moments, time cannot erase.

With open arms, they welcome every day,
Two souls entwined, forever come what may.
A love that blooms, a garden bright and fair,
Where dreams take flight, and burdens disappear.
