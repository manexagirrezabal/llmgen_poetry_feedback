 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets and offices, all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery wrapped, in a story to hold

In meetings and deals, it plays its part
A trusted companion, never to depart
From the shoulder of one who wears it with pride
It's a badge of success, that won't subside

Through trials and tribulations, it stands tall
A faithful friend, through it all.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
