The final curtain falls, a silent scene,
A whispered sigh escapes, the breath is gone.
No longer do we walk, no laughter keen,
Only echoes linger, soft and drawn.

The body sleeps, a shell of earthly form,
A tapestry unwoven, thread by thread.
But memories bloom, a comforting storm,
Where love's bright embers still burn, undread.

Though darkness claims us, fear not the night,
For stars ignite above, in endless gleam.
Beyond the veil, a new and radiant light,
A whispered promise, like a flowing stream.

Death is a doorway, leading to unknown,
Where souls find solace, forever flown.
