A whisper soft, a touch so light,
Your eyes ignite a burning bright.
A smile that melts away the night,
And fills my world with pure delight.

Your laughter rings, a melody,
That sets my soul eternally free.
With every beat, my heart will see
The love we share, eternally.

Through storms and sunshine, side by side,
Our bond unyielding, our love's tide.
A tapestry woven, thread by thread,
A promise whispered, never dead.

In you I find, a perfect place,
Forever bound, with love's embrace.
