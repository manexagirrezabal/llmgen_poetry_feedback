 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
A gentle breeze rustles through the night.

The stars come out and twinkle fast,
A celestial show that will forever last.
The world is quiet, still and deep,
In nature's beauty, my soul does keep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you to enjoy. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
