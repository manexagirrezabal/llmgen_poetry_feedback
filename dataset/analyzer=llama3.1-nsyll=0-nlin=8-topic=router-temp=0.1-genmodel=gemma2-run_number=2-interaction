 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam.

It guides the flow, a tireless, constant guide,
Through networks vast, where information hides.
A humble hero, in its plastic shell,
The router weaves the web, where stories dwell. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
