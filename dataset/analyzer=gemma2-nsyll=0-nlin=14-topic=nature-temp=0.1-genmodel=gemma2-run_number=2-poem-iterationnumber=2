Sunlight paints the leaves in shades of green,
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Flowers bloom, a vibrant, colorful scene,
As nature's symphony gently appease.

A babbling brook dances over smooth stones,
Reflecting azure skies, so bright and clear,
While birdsong fills the air with joyful tones,
Chasing away shadows, banishing fear.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Invites the soul to wander, free and light,
Where ancient trees their silent stories send,
And stars ignite the canvas of the night.

In nature's embrace, we find our peace profound.
