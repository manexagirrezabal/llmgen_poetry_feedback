A whispered word, a touch so light and sweet,
Love's gentle flame, our hearts complete.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's embrace, we find our happy place.

Through fields of green where wildflowers softly bloom,
Love's guiding star, dispels the darkest gloom.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths unknown,
Sharing laughter, making dreams our own.

With every glance, a spark ignites anew,
A love that burns with passion, strong and true.
No distance vast, no time can ever tear,
This bond we share, beyond all compare.
Two hearts united, forever meant to be.
