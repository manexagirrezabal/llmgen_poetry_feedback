Sunlight paints the leaves with gold,
A gentle breeze whispers through trees bold.
Crimson berries on branches sway,
As clouds drift by in a milky way.

Flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's canvas, breathtaking views.
Butterflies dance on wings so light,
A symphony of colors, day and night.

Crystal streams flow with tranquil sound,
Life abounds on hallowed ground.
Mountains stand tall, guardians grand,
Protecting nature's ancient land.

In every corner, beauty resides,
A tapestry woven, where wonder abides.
