 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent moonlight casts its gentle glow
A midnight sky with stars that softly flow
The world is hushed in quiet sleep
As darkness reigns and all is deep

The trees stand tall with leaves outstretched
Their shadows dancing on the frosty breast
The wind whispers secrets through the night
And all around, a peaceful sight

In this still hour, I find my peace
A calm that soothes the soul's release
My heart beats slow, my spirit free
As in the darkness, I am me

The world is full of noise and strife
But here, in silence, I find life.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a peaceful poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
