In the streets, it piles so high
A mountain of waste, passing by
Plastic and paper, discarded with care
Leaving behind a world that's hard to bear

The earth cries out in anguish and pain
As humans recklessly contribute to its stain
The once blue skies are now gray and old
A reflection of the garbage we're told
