Your hand in mine, a gentle squeeze,
A spark ignites, a love that frees.
My heart beats fast, a joyful sound,
As we explore love's hallowed ground.

Your eyes reflect a starry night,
Guiding me through darkness, pure and bright.
With every touch, a tender flame,
Whispering secrets, calling my name.

Two souls entwined, a tapestry spun,
A symphony of love, just begun.
Forever bound by destiny's thread,
Our love will bloom, forever spread.

Through life's embrace, we'll stand as one,
Two hearts united, 'til day is done.
