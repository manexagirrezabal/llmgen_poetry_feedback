The wind whispers secrets through leaves of jade,
Sunlight paints meadows in hues gold and red.
A babbling brook dances, a melody played,
By stones smooth and worn, where wildflowers spread.
Clouds drift like dreams across the azure sky,
And birds sing their praises, soaring high.
Nature's symphony, a lullaby.
