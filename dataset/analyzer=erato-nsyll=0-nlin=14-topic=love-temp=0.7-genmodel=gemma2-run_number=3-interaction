 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a stolen glance,
A touch that sets the soul in dance.
Love blooms within, a fragile flower,
Nourished by trust and tender hour.

Laughter shared, a silent tear,
Moments precious, held so dear.
Through storms and sun, a constant guide,
A beacon bright, side by side.

With open hearts, we give our all,
In love's embrace, we rise and fall.
A tapestry woven, thread by thread,
Forever bound, though words unsaid. 

Two souls entwined, a love so true,
A masterpiece painted, me and you.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š
