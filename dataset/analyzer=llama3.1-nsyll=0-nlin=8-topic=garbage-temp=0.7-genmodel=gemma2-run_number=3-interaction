 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Of broken dreams and things denied.
We cast it out, a careless hand,
Forgotten waste upon the land.
The earth groans low, a weary sigh,
Beneath the weight of what we buy.
Can beauty bloom from refuse heaps?
Will mountains rise from plastic sleeps? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other requests. ğŸ˜Š
