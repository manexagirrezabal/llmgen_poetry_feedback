A briefcase, leather bound, a trusted guide,
It holds ambitions that will never hide.
Within its depths, contracts take their stand,
And futures forged by an unseen hand.

From boardroom walls to bustling city streets,
It walks with purpose, where ambition meets.
A silent witness to triumphs and despair,
The briefcase carries burdens, light or rare.

Each click of latch, a whispered promise made,
Of goals achieved, and fortunes to be laid.
A symbol of success, a tool of trade,
It journeys onward, never to be swayed.
