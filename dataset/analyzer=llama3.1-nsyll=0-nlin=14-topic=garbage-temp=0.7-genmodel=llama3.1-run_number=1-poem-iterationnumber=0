In twisted bags and discarded piles,
Garbage accumulates with stealthy smiles.
 Forgotten treasures lost to time,
Their worthlessness is hard to define.

The stench of rot and mold does rise,
As broken dreams and leftovers demise.
A landscape littered, soulless grey,
Where beauty once did bloom and sway.

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As plastic wraps and bottles grow.
In oceans deep, a darkened sea,
Garbage chokes the life from you and me.

We must reduce, reuse, and recycle too,
For a cleaner world, our future shines through.
