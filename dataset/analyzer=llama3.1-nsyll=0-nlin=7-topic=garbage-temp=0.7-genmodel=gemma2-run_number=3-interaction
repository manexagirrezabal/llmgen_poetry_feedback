 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of waste, a plastic sea,
Forgotten remnants, meant to be free.
Bottles and cans, crumpled and torn,
Leftovers discarded, on asphalt born.
A stench that lingers, a sight to shun,
Nature cries out, beneath the sun.
Cleanliness forgotten, a world undone.
