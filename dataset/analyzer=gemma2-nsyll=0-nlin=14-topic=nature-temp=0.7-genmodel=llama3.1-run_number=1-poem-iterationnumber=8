The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves of green,
Their branches swaying in the breeze serene.

The flowers bloom in every hue,
From vibrant red to soft blue.
The forest floor is carpeted deep,
With petals, leaves, and secrets asleep.

The river flows with gentle might,
Reflecting sunbeams in its light.
The mountains rise in rugged stone,
A testament to nature's work alone.

In this wild beauty I am free,
Connected to the world's harmony.
