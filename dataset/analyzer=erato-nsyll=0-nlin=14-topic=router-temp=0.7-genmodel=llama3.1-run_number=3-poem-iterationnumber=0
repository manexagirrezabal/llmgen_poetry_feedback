In hidden corners, it's often found
A silent guardian, of internet all around
The router's hum, a gentle sound
As it connects us, to the digital ground

Its antennas high, its ports so fine
It routes the traffic, with precision divine
Through wires and airwaves, it finds its way
Connecting devices, night and day

With Wi-Fi names, that we can't ignore
It broadcasts signals, forever in store
A hub of activity, yet so serene
As data flows through, like a digital stream

In this modern age, it's a vital part
Of our online lives, beating within the heart
