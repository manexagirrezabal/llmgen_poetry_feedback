 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms to the sky
Receiving and sending, as the traffic goes by
It navigates the net, with precision and care
Directing packets home, with no time to spare

In the background, it works tirelessly night
A guardian of networks, shining with delight
It adapts to changes, with a flexible mind
Routing data efficiently, all the time

With Wi-Fi's gentle touch, it reaches far and wide
Connecting devices, side by side
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
