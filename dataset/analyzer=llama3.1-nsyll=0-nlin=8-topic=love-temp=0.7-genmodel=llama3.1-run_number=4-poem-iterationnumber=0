Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and guiding through the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And with each kiss, our love abides.
Through laughter and tears, it stands as one,
Forever and always, under the sun.
