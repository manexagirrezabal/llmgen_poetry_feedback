A fortress of leather, sturdy and brown,
Holds secrets within, whispered and known.
Papers and dreams, contracts and plans,
All locked tight, held in its metal hands.

It walks beside, a silent confidant,
Through bustling streets, a steady participant.
Boardroom meetings, deals struck with grace,
A symbol of power, a time and place.

But sometimes it's empty, a hollow shell,
Reflecting dreams that have ceased to compel.
A weight on the shoulder, a burden to bear,
Of aspirations unfulfilled, a silent despair.

Yet hope remains, within its dark core,
That new journeys will start, and explore.
