A whispered word, a tender gaze,
Love's gentle flame, in hearts ablaze.
Two souls entwined, a sacred dance,
Lost in a world, a sweet romance.

Through sunlit fields and moonlit skies,
Love's melody, our spirits rise.
Hand in hand, we walk as one,
Sharing dreams beneath the sun.

With every touch, a spark ignites,
A love that burns with pure delights.
No distance vast, no time can sever,
This bond we share, forever after. 
A symphony of hearts, eternally free.
