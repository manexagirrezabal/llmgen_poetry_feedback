 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds secrets safe within,
Dreams and deals, hopes up and down,
From boardroom walls to sun-soaked skin.
A silent witness, strong and sleek,
To meetings won and losses bleak,
The briefcase whispers tales unique. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ðŸ˜Š   Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
