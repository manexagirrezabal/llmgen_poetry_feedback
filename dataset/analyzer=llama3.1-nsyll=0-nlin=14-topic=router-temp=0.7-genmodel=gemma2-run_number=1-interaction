 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, a box of might,
The router stands, unseen, day and night.
Invisible threads it weaves with care,
Connecting worlds, dispelling despair.

From laptops small to screens so grand,
It sends and gathers data's strand.
A symphony of packets flow,
Through wires thin, or waves that go.

Websites bloom, emails take flight,
The router guides them, day and night.
A digital bridge, a modern art,
Connecting hearts, playing its part.

So thank the box, though small and plain,
For weaving worlds, easing our strain. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
