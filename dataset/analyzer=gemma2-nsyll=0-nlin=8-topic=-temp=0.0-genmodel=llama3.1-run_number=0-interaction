 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and shadows fill the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As darkness reigns, the night says goodbye
The stars up high, they twinkle fast
In this still hour, the heart finds rest at last
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
