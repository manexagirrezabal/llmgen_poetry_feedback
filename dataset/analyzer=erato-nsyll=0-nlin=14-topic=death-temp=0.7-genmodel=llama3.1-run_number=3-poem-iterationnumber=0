In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's whispered call begins its sway
A gentle breeze that stirs the air
And summons souls to leave their lair

With silent steps, it glides unseen
Through mortal hearts, a sorrow keen
It brings an end to life's warm light
And wraps in darkness endless night

Yet in its wake, a memory stays
Of love and laughter, joyous days
A fleeting glimpse of what has been
Lost to the void, forever unseen

In death's dark shadow, we find our fate.
