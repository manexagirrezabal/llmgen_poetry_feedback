A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes in the morning dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life unwound, both brave and young and old.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories linger, cherished and confessed.

But death is not an ending, some believe,
A transformation, where souls gently weave
Through realms unknown, beyond the mortal sight,
Embracing darkness, bathed in endless light.

So fear it not, this final, fleeting sleep,
For life's true essence ever runs so deep.
