A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It hums and glows, a beacon in the night,
Connecting worlds with data's swift flight.

From laptop screens to phones held tight,
It weaves a tapestry, both dark and bright.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
Where information flows, a constant tide.

But hidden depths within its shell reside,
Complex algorithms, where packets hide.
MAC addresses, IP's untold,
A language whispered, stories yet unfold.

So thank the router, humble and discreet,
For bridging gaps and making connections sweet.
