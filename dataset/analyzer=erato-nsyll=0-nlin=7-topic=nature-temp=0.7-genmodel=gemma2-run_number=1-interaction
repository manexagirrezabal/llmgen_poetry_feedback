 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints the sky in gold,
Whispering winds through leaves of emerald bold.
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
As twilight dances, casting shadows fair.
Flowers bloom, a vibrant tapestry,
Nature's beauty, for all eyes to see.
Peace descends, a tranquil reverie. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Is there anything else I can help you with?
