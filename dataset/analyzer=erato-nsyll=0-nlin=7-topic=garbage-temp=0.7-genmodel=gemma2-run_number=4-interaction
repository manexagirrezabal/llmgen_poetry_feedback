 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic bags and crumpled cans,
A symphony of waste that spans.
Paper scraps and broken toys,
A mountain grows, a world annoys.
Landfills swell, a somber sight,
Where nature's balance takes a flight.
Let us choose a greener way. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
