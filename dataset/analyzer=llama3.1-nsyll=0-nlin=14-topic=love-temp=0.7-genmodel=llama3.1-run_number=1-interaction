 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In each other's arms, we'll find our home.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together forever, beneath the sun.

Love is a choice that we make each day,
To cherish and adore in every way.
It's a bond that's strong, yet gentle too,
A connection that will forever shine through.

In love's sweet light, our hearts entwine.
