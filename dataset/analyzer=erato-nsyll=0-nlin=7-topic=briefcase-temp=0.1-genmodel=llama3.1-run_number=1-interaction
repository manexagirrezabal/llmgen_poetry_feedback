 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather briefcase, worn with care
Holds secrets and documents to share
Its metal clasps shine like polished stone
As it's carried through city streets alone
The weight of its contents is a burden true
But the person who carries it sees it anew
A trusted companion, always by their side
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
