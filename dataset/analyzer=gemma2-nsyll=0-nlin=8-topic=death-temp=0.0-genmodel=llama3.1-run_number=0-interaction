 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land

With whispered words, he seals the fate
And in his wake, a void creates
The living mourn, the dead are free
In eternal rest, they find their sea
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem or make any changes to this one, feel free to ask.
