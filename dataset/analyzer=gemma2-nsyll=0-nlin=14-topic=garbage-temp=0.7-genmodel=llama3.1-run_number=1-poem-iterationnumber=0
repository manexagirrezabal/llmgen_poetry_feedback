In twisted heaps, it lies in store
A monument to waste and more
Plastic bags, discarded with disdain
Their once-proud purpose now but vain

Food scraps and containers, all astray
Filling landfills, day by endless day
The weight of our excess, a burden to bear
As the earth groans beneath the garbage's snare

In alleys dark, it festers and grows
A toxic stew, with no place to go
The stench of rot, a putrid smell
Wafts through the air, a foul tale to tell

We reap what we sow, in this plastic age
Our waste, a legacy that will turn the page
