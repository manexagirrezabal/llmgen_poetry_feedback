 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch, a tender sigh,
A feeling that reaches to the sky.

With every beat, our hearts entwine,
In perfect harmony, we align.
Our love shines on, like stars in the sea,
Forever and always, meant to be.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
