Garbage piles high on the ground
A smelly mess all around
Food and drink containers abound
Plastic bags tangled up profound

Discarded papers scattered wide
Old newspapers, crumpled with pride
Glass bottles shattered on the floor
Their fragments a hazardous score

The earth protests with every heap
As toxins seep from each dark creep
The air grows thick with stench and grime
A reflection of our waste's crime

We must take care to reduce and reuse
And recycle, for our future's muse
