 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, sleek and fine

A trusted companion, in a busy pace
Elegance and utility, in perfect space
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
