 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's whispered call begins its sway
A gentle breeze that stirs the air
And summons souls to leave their lair

With silent steps, it glides unseen
Through mortal hearts, a sorrow keen
It brings an end to life's warm light
And wraps in darkness endless night

Yet in its wake, a memory stays
Of love and laughter, joyous days
A fleeting glimpse of what has been
Lost to the void, forever unseen

In death's dark shadow, we find our fate.

In death's dark shadow, we find our fate
Where sorrow reigns, an eternal state
