 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Tin cans and bottles, a papery shroud,
Forgotten remnants, once proud and loud.
The stench of decay, a bitter perfume,
A testament to waste, consuming our bloom.
Oh, garbage, you haunt us with your grim embrace,
A mirror reflecting our careless disgrace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
