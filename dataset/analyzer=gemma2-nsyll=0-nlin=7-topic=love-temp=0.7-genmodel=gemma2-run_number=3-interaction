 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
With gentle touch and whispered word,
A bond is forged, forever heard.
Through sunlit days and stormy nights,
Love's guiding star, a beacon bright.
Forevermore, hearts beat as one. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
