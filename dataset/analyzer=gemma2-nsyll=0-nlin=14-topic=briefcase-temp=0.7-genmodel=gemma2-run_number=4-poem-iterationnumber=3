A briefcase stands, a sentinel of day,
Of leather bound and polished in its sway.
It holds the weight of dreams both grand and small,
The hopes that rise and promises to call.

Within its depths, ambition takes its flight,
With plans and schemes concealed from mortal sight.
From boardroom battles to the quiet street,
It walks beside us, triumphs bittersweet.

A silent witness to the human race,
Its every hinge a testament to grace.
A symbol of success, or failure's sting,
The briefcase carries all that life can bring.
