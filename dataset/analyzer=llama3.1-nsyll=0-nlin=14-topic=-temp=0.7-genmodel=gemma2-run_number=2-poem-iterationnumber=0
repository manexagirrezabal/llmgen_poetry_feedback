The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, stories untold.
Sunlight paints shadows, long and serene,
As twilight descends, a velvet scene.

Stars begin to glimmer, diamonds bright,
Guiding weary souls through the silent night.
A lone owl hoots, its mournful cry rings true,
Echoing dreams beneath the moon's soft hue.

The world sleeps soundly, wrapped in mystery,
While thoughts unfurl, wild and eternally free.
Time stands still, a moment held dear,
Until dawn arrives, banishing all fear.

And with the sunrise, a new day will start,
A canvas blank, waiting for an artist's art.
