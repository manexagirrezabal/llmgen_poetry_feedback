 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Its leather worn, its metal small.
It holds the tools of a busy day,
Papers, pens, and a laptop in play.
With every step, it's by our side,
A constant companion, never to divide.
Through meetings and deadlines, it stays true,
A faithful friend, for me and you.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
