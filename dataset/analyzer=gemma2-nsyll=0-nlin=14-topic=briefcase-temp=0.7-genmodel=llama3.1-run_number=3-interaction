 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a staple of might
A briefcase lies open, its secrets in sight
Leather bound and worn, with scuffs on the side
It holds the tools for a businessman to glide

In its compartments, papers and pens reside
A laptop fits snugly, where files abide
A portable office, that follows him each day
As he rushes to meetings, in a busy way

Its contents are varied, from contracts to mail
Important documents, that require careful tale
It's a trusted companion, through negotiations long
Helping to close deals, with a confident song

In the boardroom or lobby, it's always by his side
A briefcase full of possibilities, where business will reside
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
