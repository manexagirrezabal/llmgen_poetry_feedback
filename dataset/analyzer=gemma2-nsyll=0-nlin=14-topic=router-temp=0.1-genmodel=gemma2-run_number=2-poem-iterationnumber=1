A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
The router stands, its secrets it will keep.
It speaks in packets, data's fleeting flight,
Connecting worlds both day and darkest night.

From screens to phones, a web it does extend,
A silent guardian, till the very end.
No fanfare rings, no trumpets sound its praise,
Yet through its wires, knowledge finds its ways.

It bridges gaps, unites us far and wide,
A digital heart, where thoughts can freely ride.
So let us thank this humble, unseen friend,
Whose constant work, our lives does comprehend. 

A silent hero, in the modern age,
The router's power, on history's page.
