In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A mess that's made, for me and you.

The smell is strong, a putrid stench,
That clings to all, like a bad wrench.
Food scraps rot, and mold takes hold,
As nature's beauty starts to unfold.

In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
Where earthworms crawl, through endless night.
But still we throw, without a care,
And let the garbage pile up there.

The consequences mount, with each new day,
A world awry, in disarray.
