The moonbeams dance on silver streams,
A symphony of whispers in the breeze.
Stars ignite, celestial dreams,
And fireflies paint the twilight trees.

A gentle owl calls from its perch so high,
While crickets chirp a lullaby.
The world sleeps soft beneath the sky,
A tapestry of peace, where worries die.
