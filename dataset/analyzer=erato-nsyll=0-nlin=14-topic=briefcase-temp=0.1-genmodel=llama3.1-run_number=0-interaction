 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase sits upon my floor
Its leather worn, its handle poor
It holds my papers, my notes so fine
My daily tools, my constant sign

Of meetings and deals, of talks and strife
It's a symbol of my working life
I grab it tight, I'm ready to go
And face the day with all its woe

The weight inside, a burden true
A reflection of the tasks anew
I zip it shut, I take a breath
And head out into the busy depth

My briefcase by my side, I stride
Through crowded streets, where time won't subside
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
