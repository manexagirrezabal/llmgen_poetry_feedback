 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
On velvet skies, where shadows leer.
A whisper sighs through rustling leaves,
As darkness dances, and silence weaves.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Illuminate the lonely night.
A world asleep, in slumber deep,
While secrets dance, and mysteries keep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  😊  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one! 🖋️✨
