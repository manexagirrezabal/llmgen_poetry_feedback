 > assistant: Silent stars shine bright in the night
A celestial show, a gentle sight
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep
As moonbeams dance, their vigil keep

In this still hour, I find my peace
My worries fade, my soul release
The darkness shines with starry light
A beauty that guides me through the night
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was a pleasure to create something for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
