Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
Painting dappled patterns on the forest floor.
A gentle breeze carries whispers unseen,
As nature's symphony begins to soar.

Birdsong fills the air with melodies bright,
While butterflies dance in a graceful flight.
A babbling brook murmurs a tranquil sound,
Reflecting clouds that softly drift around.

Goldenrod blooms, a vibrant yellow hue,
And crimson maples paint the autumn view.
The world awakens, bathed in morning light,
A canvas of beauty, pure and ever bright.
