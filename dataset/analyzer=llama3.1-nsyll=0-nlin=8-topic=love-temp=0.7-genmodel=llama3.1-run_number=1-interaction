 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that's hard to define,
But it's what we search for, all the time.

It's the whispered words in a lover's ear,
The gentle touch that calms every fear.
Love is a gift that's given from above,
A treasure that brings joy and endless love.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you about love. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
