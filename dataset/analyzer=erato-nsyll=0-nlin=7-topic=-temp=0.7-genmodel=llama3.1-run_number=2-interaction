 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed in quiet sleep
As shadows dance upon the wall to creep
The wind stirs softly through the trees so tall
And darkness reigns with gentle call
In this still hour, my heart can be.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
