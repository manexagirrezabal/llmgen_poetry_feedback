 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents, one and all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
With every step, it sways to and fro,
A trusted companion, wherever you go.
In meetings and deals, it's always by your side.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
