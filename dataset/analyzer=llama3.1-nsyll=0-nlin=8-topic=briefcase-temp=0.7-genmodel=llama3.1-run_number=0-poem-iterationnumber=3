A symbol of success in leather so fine,
The briefcase stands with its handle divine.
It carries files and papers with care,
And secrets it keeps with an air.

In meetings and deals, it's always by side,
A trusted companion that never divides.
Its compartments and pockets a well-planned space,
For the busy professional to keep pace.
