 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's shadow falls
A silent guest, who comes to all
It takes our breath, and ends our pain
Leaving memories, like autumn rain

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, is lost to hold
Death's mystery, we cannot define
A final rest, for mortal design
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
