 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents, one and all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
It travels far, through meetings and strife,
A trusted companion, a symbol of life.
In its depths, the world's complexities reside.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
