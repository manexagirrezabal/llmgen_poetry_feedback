 > assistant: The moonbeams dance on silver streams,
A symphony of whispers in the night,
Stars like diamonds, scattered dreams,
As shadows lengthen, fading into light.
A gentle breeze caresses leaves so green,
And crickets chirp a lullaby serene,
The world sleeps softly, a tranquil scene. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to hear another one!
