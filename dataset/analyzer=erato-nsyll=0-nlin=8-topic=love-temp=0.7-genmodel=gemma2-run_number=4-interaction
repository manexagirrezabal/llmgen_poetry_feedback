 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered low,
A gentle touch, where feelings grow.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand,
A bond unbreakable, forever planned.
Love's melody, a sweet refrain,
Two souls united, free from pain. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ğŸ˜Š  I'm glad you liked the poem.  Is there anything else I can help you with?
