The final breath escapes on silent wings,
A fading light where life's bright song once sings.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just quiet peace, where shadows softly come.

The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories dance, secrets they will keep.
But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding our souls through darkness, shining bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the sky,
Hope's gentle hand will lift us, help us fly.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
