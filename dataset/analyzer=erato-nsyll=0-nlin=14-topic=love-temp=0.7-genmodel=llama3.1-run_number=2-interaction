 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle touch ignites the flame,
Warming hearts and soothing every pain.
It's a feeling that can't be explained,
A deep connection that forever remains.

In love's sweet arms, we find our nest,
A place to rest and be at best.
With every kiss, our souls take flight,
Together we dance through day and night.

Love's beauty shines like a radiant sun,
 Illuminating all that's been undone.
It mends the broken, heals the past,
And fills our lives with joy that will last.

Through love's pure power, we're made anew,
Forever entwined, our hearts forever true.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that captured the essence of love for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
