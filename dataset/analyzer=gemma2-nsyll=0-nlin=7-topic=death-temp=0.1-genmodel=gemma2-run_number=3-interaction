 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a whispered past.
No more the sun's warm, golden grace,
Nor moonlit dreams in time and space.
Just shadows dance where light once played,
And memories linger, gently swayed.
Death's gentle touch, a peaceful sleep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
