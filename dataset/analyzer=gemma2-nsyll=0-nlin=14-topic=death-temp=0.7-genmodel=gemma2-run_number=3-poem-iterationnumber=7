The veil of night descends, a silent shroud,
As stars ignite and whisper secrets loud.
A final breath escapes, a gentle sigh,
And weary souls embark on journeys high.

No more the earthly burdens we once bore,
Just boundless freedom on an endless shore.
Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's memory lingers, like a soothing rain.

For death is not the end, but transformation's call,
A passage through the darkness, standing tall.
And in that realm of light, where spirits roam,
We find our peace, returning home.
