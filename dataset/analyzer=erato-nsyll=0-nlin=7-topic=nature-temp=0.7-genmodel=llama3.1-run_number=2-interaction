 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful forest creatures whisper by,
Rustling leaves and chirping birds at play,
A gentle brook babbles its way,
Mountains towering high and strong,
Wildflowers swaying to a soothing song,
Nature's beauty is where I belong.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that captures the beauty of nature for you. If you'd like another one, feel free to ask!
