In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A humble hero, with wires inside
Connecting devices, with speed and might
A router's purpose, in plain sight

It transmits signals, with precision and care
Allowing data to flow, without a single snare
Through its labyrinthine paths, information strays
To reach the world beyond, in endless ways

With firmware updates, it stays ahead of time
Protecting networks, from cybercrime's dark prime
A sentinel guardian, watching over the land
Keeping connections secure, with an iron hand

In the background, it works tirelessly night and day
Maintaining order, as data flows its way
