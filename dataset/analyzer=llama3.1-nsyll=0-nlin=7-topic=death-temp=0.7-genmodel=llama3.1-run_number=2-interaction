 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness falls the final night
A silence that's both calm and bright
The beating heart now still and cold
 Memories of life begin to unfold
Fading light on a face so dear
Eternal rest, without a fear
In death, there's peace, beyond all sorrow
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
