Your eyes, a starlit sky, so deep and bright,
Reflecting back my love in shades of light.
A gentle touch, a spark that ignites,
A fire within, consuming all my nights.

Your laughter rings, a symphony divine,
Each note a treasure, forever to entwine.
With every beat, my heart sings your sweet name,
Lost in a world where only love remains.

Two souls entwined, a tapestry we weave,
Woven with threads of trust we both believe.
Through life's adventures, hand in hand we'll roam,
Forever bound, our hearts forever home.
