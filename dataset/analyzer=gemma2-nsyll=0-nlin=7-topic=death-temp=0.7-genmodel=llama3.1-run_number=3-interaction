 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkened halls of silence deep,
Death's whisper echoes, secrets keep.
A final breath, a fleeting sigh,
The end of life, a mournful cry.
 Memories remain, a bittersweet pain,
A legacy that time cannot obtain,
Eternal rest, an endless sleep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
