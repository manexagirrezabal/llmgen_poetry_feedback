 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic mountains rise so high,
Tarnished cans in endless sky.
Food scraps rot, a fetid smell,
Paper whispers tales they tell.
A symphony of waste we see,
The Earth groans 'neath our apathy.
Can beauty bloom from trash's core? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️✨
