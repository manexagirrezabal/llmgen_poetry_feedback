 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's cold shadow falls
A silent thief that takes it all
 Memories of life, now lost to time
Fleeting moments, forever left behind
The heart once beating, now still and grey
Echoes of what's past, fade away
Into the void, where nothing stays
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
