 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and guiding through the night.
It's a gentle breeze on a summer's day,
A whispered promise that never fades away.
In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
Leaving room for trust, hope, and a heart full of pride.
Forever bound by love's unbreakable tie.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something you enjoyed. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
