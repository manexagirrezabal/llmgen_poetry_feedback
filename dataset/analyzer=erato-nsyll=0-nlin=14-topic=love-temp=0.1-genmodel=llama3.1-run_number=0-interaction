 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets the soul free,
A whispered promise of forever to be.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In each other's arms, we'll find our home.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together facing life, beneath the golden sun.

Love is a journey, not a destination,
A path that winds and turns with every emotion.
It's a choice to cherish, to hold and to keep,
To love without condition, in all its depth.

In love's pure light, our hearts will entwine,
Forever bound by the threads of love divine.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something that resonates with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
