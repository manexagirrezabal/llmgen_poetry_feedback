The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap 'neath the willow's shade,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And nature's symphony is gently played.

The stars emerge, like diamonds scattered bright,
Across the velvet canvas of the night,
And moonbeams bathe the world in silvery light,
A peaceful hush descends, serene and right.

In nature's embrace, our souls find rest,
A sanctuary where worries cease to test.
