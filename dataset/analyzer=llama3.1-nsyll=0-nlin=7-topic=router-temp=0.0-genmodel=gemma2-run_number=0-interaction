 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Packets dance, a digital ballet,
Through wires spun, it guides their way.
From distant shores to screens nearby,
The router hums, a constant sigh.
A bridge of bits, where worlds collide. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️✨
