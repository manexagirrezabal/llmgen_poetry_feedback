 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark whisper comes to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
It takes our breath, and makes us grand

In final sleep, we find our rest
Our hearts no longer troubled or pressed
The world moves on, without a sigh
As death's dark veil, closes our eyes
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask.
