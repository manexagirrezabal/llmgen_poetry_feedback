In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, its story told
 Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's breeze

In darkness deep, where none can see
Death's mystery awaits eternity
A silence falls, a quiet night
Where stars above, shine with pale light

And in the end, it is not pain
But peace that comes, when life is vain
