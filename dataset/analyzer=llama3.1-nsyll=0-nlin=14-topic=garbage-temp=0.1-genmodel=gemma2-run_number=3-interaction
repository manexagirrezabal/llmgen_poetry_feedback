 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where bottles and cans eternally lie.
Food scraps decay, a pungent decree,
And paper whispers tales that slowly die.

The stench hangs heavy, a choking embrace,
As nature recoils from this human blight.
Forgotten treasures in this dismal place,
Lost to the darkness, swallowed by night.

A symphony of crunching, rustling sound,
Where creatures scavenge for scraps they can find.
A silent plea, on barren ground,
For change, for action, a mindful kind.

Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this wasteland into a vibrant state. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 12 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic tide, a papery wave,
Where cans and bottles in silence rave.
Food scraps decay, a pungent stew,
Forgotten treasures, lost to view.

The stench hangs heavy, a choking haze,
As nature weeps for forgotten days.
A symphony of rustling, crunching sound,
Where creatures scavenge on barren ground.

A silent plea from this dismal sight,
For change, for action, with all our might.
Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this wasteland into a vibrant state.

This mountain of refuse, a somber sight,
A testament to our wasteful plight.
