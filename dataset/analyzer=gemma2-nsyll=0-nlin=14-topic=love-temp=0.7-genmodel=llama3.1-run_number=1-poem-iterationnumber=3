Soft whispers in the dead of night
Flickering candles, warm and bright
Two hearts beating as one, they find
A love so pure, it touches mind

In eyes that shine like stars above
They see a future built on endless love
Their laughter echoes through the day
As they dance to the rhythm of life's way

With every kiss, their souls entwine
Their love grows strong, a bond divine
Through trials and tribulations, they stand
Hand in hand, forever in each other's land
In this love, they find their peaceful nest
