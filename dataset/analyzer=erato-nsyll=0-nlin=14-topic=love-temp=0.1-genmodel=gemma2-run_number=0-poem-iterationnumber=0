A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to flow.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through stormy seas and calmest summer breeze,
Together standing, finding perfect ease.

With every beat, my heart sings your sweet name,
An endless journey, fueled by love's bright flame.
Forever bound, our destinies aligned,
Two souls as one, a love we'll always find.
