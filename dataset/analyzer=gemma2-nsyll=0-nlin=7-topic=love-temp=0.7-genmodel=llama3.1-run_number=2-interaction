 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming our hearts with its gentle light.
It's the whispered words in the dead of night,
The soft caress that brings us delight.
A bond between two souls, strong and true,
A feeling that forever sees us through.
In love's pure touch, our hearts are free.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a little poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
