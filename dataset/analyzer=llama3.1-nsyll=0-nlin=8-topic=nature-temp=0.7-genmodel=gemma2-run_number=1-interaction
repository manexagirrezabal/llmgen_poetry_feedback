 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sun-kissed leaves in emerald dance,
Whispering tales on wind's soft trance.
A babbling brook, a silver thread,
Through mossy stones, its secrets spread.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Where butterflies on nectar cruise.
Nature's canvas, vast and free,
A symphony of life for all to see. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.  âœ¨
