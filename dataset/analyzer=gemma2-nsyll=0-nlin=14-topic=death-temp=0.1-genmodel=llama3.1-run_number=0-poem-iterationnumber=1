In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, its story told
Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's breeze

In darkness lies, the body worn
The light of life, forever torn
Yet even in death, a peace is found
A release from pain, a quiet sound

And though it comes, with sorrow's sway
Death brings an end, to mortal day
