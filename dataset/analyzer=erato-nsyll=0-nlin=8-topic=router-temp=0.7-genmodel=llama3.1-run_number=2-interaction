 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A router sits in quiet place
Directing signals with steady pace
It connects and disconnects as it will
Guiding data through its digital hill

Its LED lights shine bright and bold
As it routes traffic to keep it cold
In homes and offices, it's a must-have friend
Keeping networks up until the very end
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help with the poem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
