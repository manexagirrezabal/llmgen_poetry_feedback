 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase lies on the floor
Empty and still, waiting for more
Its leather worn, its handle strong
It's been a partner, where did it go wrong?
Once full of papers, now empty space
Hoping to be filled with a new pace
Left behind, in a forgotten place
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like more poems or have specific requests, feel free to ask.
