 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek silhouette, a leather hide,
Holding secrets deep inside.
Files and folders neatly stacked,
Dreams and schemes, ambitions tracked.
Across the city, it strides with grace,
A silent promise in its space.
The briefcase whispers tales untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
