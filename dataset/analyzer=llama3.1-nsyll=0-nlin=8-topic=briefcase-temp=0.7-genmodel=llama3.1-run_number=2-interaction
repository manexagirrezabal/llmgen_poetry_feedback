 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A worn leather briefcase by my side
Holds secrets and documents with pride
Its sturdy frame and locks so strong
Protecting what's inside all day long

With every step, it stirs with care
Its contents a mystery to share
In meetings and deals, it plays its part
A trusted companion, always near the heart
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
