A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and cans, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature's light gives way.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and torn, forgotten and lost.
Food scraps and remnants, a sorry sight,
A testament to what we've paid the cost.

But in this chaos, a chance to mend,
To recycle, reuse, and start anew.
Let's turn this burden into a friend,
And build a future where waste is few.

For Earth deserves our care and grace,
A cleaner world, a brighter space.
