 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
As autumn paints the world in hues untold.
Crimson and amber, a fiery embrace,
Sunlight dances on a fading grace.
Squirrels gather treasures, winter's near,
A symphony of stillness, crystal clear.
Nature sighs softly, a lullaby sweet.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊 🍂  Let me know if you'd like to hear another one!
