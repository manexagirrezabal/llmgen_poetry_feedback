 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather case, so sturdy and strong
Carries papers, all day long
The businessman's trusty sidekick true
Protects his files, with a secure hue

Inside its depths, a world is confined
Important documents, safely aligned
A symbol of power, in every stride
The briefcase follows, by the executive's side
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
