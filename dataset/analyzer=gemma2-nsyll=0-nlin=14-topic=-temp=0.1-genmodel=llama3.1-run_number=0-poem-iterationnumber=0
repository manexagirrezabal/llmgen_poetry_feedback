Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and shadows fill the space

The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As trees sway gently, side by side
Their leaves rustling soft, a soothing sound
That echoes through the quiet ground

In this still night, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The world may be loud, but here I'm free
Where moonbeams dance, and darkness sees

The beauty of the night, it's mine to keep
A treasure hidden, in a peaceful sleep
