 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
With latches firm and clasps that hold,
A universe within it found:
Deals struck, dreams bought, stories told.
It walks with men in boardroom light,
Or rests unseen in shadowed night,
A silent witness to their fight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š   Let me know if there's anything else I can write for you.
