 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and town.
Inside, a world of plans unfold,
In spreadsheets neat and stories told.
Each click and clank, a silent chime,
A rhythm marking passing time.
From boardroom bright to coffee shop,
The briefcase guards secrets, with nary a drop. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
