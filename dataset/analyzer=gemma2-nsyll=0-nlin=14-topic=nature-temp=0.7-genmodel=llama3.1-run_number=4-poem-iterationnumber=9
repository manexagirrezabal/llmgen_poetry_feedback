Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful evening, twilight high.
The forest whispers through the trees,
A soothing melody that brings us to our knees.

Rustling leaves and chirping birds in flight,
Dance with wind, a gentle delight.
Majestic mountains touch the clouds so bright,
Their rugged peaks, a breathtaking sight.

Silent rivers flow, their waters pure and blue,
Reflecting sunbeams, a vision anew.
Wildflowers bloom, their colors bold and free,
Filling hearts with joy, as nature's beauty we see.
The stars appear at night's dark veil slowly,
A celestial show that calms the soul,
Nature's peace is a gift to us all.
