 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered branches sighs,
As shadows lengthen 'neath the fading skies.
The heart that beat with passion now is still,
And memories dance upon a distant hill.

But though the body sleeps in earthen bed,
The soul takes flight, on wings unseen, unsaid.
To realms unknown, where mysteries unfold,
A journey whispered, never to be told.

So fear not death, its touch both cold and kind,
For life's true essence lingers, left behind. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the touch, the voice, the loving gaze,
Just empty space where laughter used to blaze.

A silent tear falls on a withered rose,
As memory's garden gently overflows.
But in the stillness, whispers softly rise,
Of moments shared beneath celestial skies.

The soul takes flight, on wings unseen and free,
To realms unknown, beyond mortality.
And though the body sleeps in slumber deep,
Love's echo lingers, secrets it will keep.

So let us grieve, yet find solace in the light,
That death is but a passage to the night.
