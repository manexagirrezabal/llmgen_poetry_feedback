 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The curtain falls, the final act is done,
A silent hush descends, the day is won.
No more the laughter, no more the tears,
Just stillness deep, and fading fears.
A journey ends, a soul takes flight,
Into the darkness, veiled from light.
And memories linger, bittersweet and bright.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️ ✨
