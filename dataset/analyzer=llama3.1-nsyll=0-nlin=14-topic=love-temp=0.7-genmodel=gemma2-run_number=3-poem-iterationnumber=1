A glance exchanged, a silent understanding,
Two hearts that beat in rhythm, hand in hand.
Love's gentle touch, a whisper softly landing,
A bond unbreakable, forever planned.

Through laughter shared and secrets gently told,
A tapestry of memories, stories unfold.
Like stars that shine in twilight's velvet sky,
Their love ignites, soaring ever high.

In every sunrise, hope anew is found,
Two souls entwined, on sacred ground.
With trust as anchor, fears begin to fade,
Love's tender promise, a future bravely made.

And as the years unfold, their love will stay,
A beacon burning bright, come what may.
