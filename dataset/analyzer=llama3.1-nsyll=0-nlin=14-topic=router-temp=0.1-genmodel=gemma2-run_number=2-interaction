 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It speaks in packets, a language unknown,
Connecting worlds, making data flown.

From distant servers to screens aglow,
It guides the traffic, ebb and flow.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
Where information flows, side by side.

With antennas reaching, it scans the air,
For signals faint, beyond compare.
A tireless worker, day and night,
Ensuring connection, shining bright.

So thank the router, humble and small,
It keeps us linked, answering every call. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
