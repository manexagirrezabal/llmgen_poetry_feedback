Your eyes, a deep and endless ocean blue,
Reflecting back my love, sincere and true.
A gentle touch, a spark that sets aflame,
A burning passion, whispering your name.

With every glance, my heart skips a beat,
Entranced by you, both charming and discreet.
Your laughter rings, a melody so sweet,
Washing over me, making life complete.

Two souls entwined, a love forever bright,
Guiding our path through darkest night.
We'll walk as one, hand clasped in gentle hold,
A story written, never to grow old.
