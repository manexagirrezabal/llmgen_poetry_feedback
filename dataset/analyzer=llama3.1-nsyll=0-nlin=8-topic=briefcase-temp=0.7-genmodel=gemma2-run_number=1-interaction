 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
With clasps that snap and lock it down.
Inside, a world of paper lies,
Of dreams and schemes and future tries.
It holds ambition, hope, and fear,
The weight of burdens, held so dear.
From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
A briefcase whispers secrets sweet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
