 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's whispered name sends souls away
A mysterious guest, unknown and cold
Stealing life from hearts that grow old

With silent steps, it glides unseen
A harbinger of fate unclean
It claims the young and worn with age
Leaving loved ones to turn the page

 Memories linger, a bittersweet refrain
Echoes of what can never be regained
The weight of loss, a grief so true
A sorrow that forever shines through

In darkness lies the final rest
Where mortal dreams are lost in death's nest
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something fitting for your request. If you'd like more poems or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
