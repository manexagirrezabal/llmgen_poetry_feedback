Amidst the streets, a sorry sight
Garbage piled high, without a fight
Rancid smells and putrid decay
A blight on society's busy way

Plastic bottles, crumpled up tight
Cans and cartons, a dismal sight
Forgotten wrappers, torn and worn
Litter scattered, like a bad norm

The earth cries out, in anguish deep
As humans waste, without a creep
Their actions echo, through the years to come
A legacy of trash, forever numb

But still we hope, for a cleaner way 
To live in harmony, starting today
