 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon, a silver coin in night's deep purse,
Casts shadows long on emerald grass.
A lone owl hoots, a whispered verse,
As stars like diamonds softly pass.
The wind sighs through the willow trees,
A lullaby of rustling leaves.
And slumber claims the world with ease. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š  I'm glad you liked it.   Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
