The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon the velvet cloak of night,
Stars whisper secrets, soft and clear,
As shadows dance in flickering light.

A gentle breeze through branches sighs,
Carrying scents of earth and bloom,
While crickets chirp their lullabies,
Beneath the silent, watchful moon.

The world is hushed, a peaceful scene,
Where worries fade and troubles cease,
And weary souls find solace keen,
In nature's calming, sweet release.

So let us rest, our spirits mend,
Until the dawn begins to blend.
