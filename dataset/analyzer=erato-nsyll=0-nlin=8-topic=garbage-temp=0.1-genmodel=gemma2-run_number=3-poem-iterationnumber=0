A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Tin cans and bottles, a papery shroud,
Forgotten remnants, once proud and loud.
The stench of decay, a bitter perfume,
A testament to waste, consuming our bloom.
Oh, garbage, you haunt us with your grim embrace,
A mirror reflecting our careless disgrace.
