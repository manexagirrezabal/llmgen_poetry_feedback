Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
In each other's arms, we've just begun.
The world may fade, but love will remain,
A constant heartbeat that forever sustains.

Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
A bond so strong that time can't repress.
It's a whispered promise in the dead of night,
A love so pure that shines like a guiding light.

In love's sweet refuge, we find our peace,
And with each other, our hearts release freely.
