 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness claims its own,
A final breath, a life overthrown.
The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows still,
Death's chill grasp, a mortal's will.

 Memories remain, a bittersweet refrain,
Of laughter, love, and joy in vain.
In silence, death finds its repose,
And takes the soul to unknown dozes.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
