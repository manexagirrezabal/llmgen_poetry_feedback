Mountain peaks touch the sky so high,
Rivers flow with gentle, soothing sigh.
Trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A forest's heartbeat, wild and carefree.
The sun shines bright, its warm rays abide,
In fields of green, wildflowers bloom with pride.
Nature's beauty, a treasure to behold inside.
