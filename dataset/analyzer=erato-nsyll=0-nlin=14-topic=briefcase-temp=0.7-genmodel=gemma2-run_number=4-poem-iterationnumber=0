A humble case of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and hopes unknown.
Within its depths, contracts finely spun,
And plans that rise like morning's golden sun.

A silent witness to boardroom wars,
Where fortunes shift and ambition roars.
It guards the secrets whispered in the night,
And carries burdens under dim lamplight.

From bustling streets to office sterile halls,
It traverses paths where fate installs
Its twists and turns, its triumphs and its falls.
The briefcase stands, a symbol for us all,
Of journeys taken, victories and thralls.
