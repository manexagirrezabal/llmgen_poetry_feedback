 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter echoes, whispers low,
Trust and comfort, hearts aglow.
Through storms they weather, side by side,
With gentle touch, their love will guide.
A bond unbreakable, pure and true,
Forever bound, me and you. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š 

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you'd like to explore any other creative writing ideas.  âœ¨
