A symphony of plastic, metal, glass,
A cacophony of wrappers, once in use.
Forgotten feasts, and dreams that did not last,
Now festering refuse, a noxious muse.

The overflowing bins, a silent plea,
For mindful choices, less waste to create.
Mountains rise, a grim reality,
Where nature's bounty meets its bitter fate.

We leave behind our fleeting wants and needs,
A legacy of litter, staining green.
Can we reclaim what broken hope seeds?
Or will this burden ever be unseen?

Let consciousness replace the careless throw,
And turn the tide of trash, where beauty may grow.
