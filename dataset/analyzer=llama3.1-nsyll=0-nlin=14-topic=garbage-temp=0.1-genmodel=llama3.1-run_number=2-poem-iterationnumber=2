In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A mountain high, a dismal fact.

The smell of rot and decay fills air,
As nature's beauty is beyond repair.
We reap what we sow, it's plain to see,
A world of waste, a tragedy to be.

Let's reduce, reuse, recycle with care,
And show the earth we truly do dare.
