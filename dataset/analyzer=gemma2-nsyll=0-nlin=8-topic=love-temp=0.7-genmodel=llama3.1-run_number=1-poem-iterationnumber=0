Love's flame burns bright and true,
A beacon in the darkness shines through.
It warms the heart and soothes the soul,
And makes our lives whole.

In its gentle touch, we find our peace,
A sense of calm that will never cease.
With love, all fears and doubts subside,
And in its presence, hearts reside.
