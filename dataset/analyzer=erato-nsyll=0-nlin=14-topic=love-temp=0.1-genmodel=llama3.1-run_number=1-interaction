 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

With every kiss, our hearts beat fast,
Our love for each other will forever last.
In your eyes, my heart finds a home,
Where I am safe and never alone.

Your smile is contagious, it lights the way,
For me to follow you through life's busy day.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together facing whatever comes our way, under the sun.

Our love will grow with each passing year,
And forever be a beacon that wipes away all fear.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about love for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
