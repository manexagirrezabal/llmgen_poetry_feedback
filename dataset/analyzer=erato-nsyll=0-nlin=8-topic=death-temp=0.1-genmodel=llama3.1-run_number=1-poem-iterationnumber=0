In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land

With whispered words, he claims his own
And leads the soul to a secret throne
Where darkness reigns, and light does fade
And in its place, eternal sleep is made
