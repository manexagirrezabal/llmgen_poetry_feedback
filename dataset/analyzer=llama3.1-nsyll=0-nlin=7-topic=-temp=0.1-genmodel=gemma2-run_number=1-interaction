 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
On velvet skies, where shadows leer.
A whisper sighs through rustling leaves,
As darkness weaves its magic sleeves.
Stars ignite, a diamond dust,
And silence falls, a sacred trust.
Night's gentle hand, a soft caress. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  Perhaps on a different theme?  âœ¨
