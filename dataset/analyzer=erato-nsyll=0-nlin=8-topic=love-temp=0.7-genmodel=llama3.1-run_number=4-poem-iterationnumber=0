Love's flame burns bright and true,
A gentle fire that shines through.
It warms the heart and lights the way,
And chases fears and doubts away.

In its pure light, we find our home,
Where hearts are safe and souls are known.
With every beat, it grows more strong,
Forever guiding us where love belongs.
