A spark ignites within my soul's deep well,
When your eyes meet mine, a story to tell.
Your laughter dances, music to my ears,
Dispelling shadows, calming all my fears.

Your touch, a whisper, soft upon my skin,
Awakens longing, letting passions begin.
We weave a tapestry of hopes and dreams,
Bound by threads of love's eternal beams.

Through storms we'll weather, hand in hand we'll stand,
A fortress built on trust, a sacred land.
Forever bound, our hearts beat as one,
Underneath the sun, until life is done.

Our love, a masterpiece, forever to unfold,
A story whispered, never to grow old.
