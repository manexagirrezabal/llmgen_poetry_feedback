A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Bottles and cans, a tangled mess,
Forgotten treasures, put to the test.
The earth groans under its weight so vast,
A silent plea, a future overcast.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a legacy, clean and grand.
