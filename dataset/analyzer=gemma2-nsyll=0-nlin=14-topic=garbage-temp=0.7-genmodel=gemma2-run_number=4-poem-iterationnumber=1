Plastic bottles, crumpled cans, and foil,
A tangled mess of what we cast aside.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams that lost their spoil,
In overflowing bins, where hopes collide.

The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
A silent burden on the earth's embrace.
Landfills grow, a monument to haste,
Where nature's balance finds its fragile space.

But even here, life seeks a way to thrive,
Among the refuse, finding strength to strive.
A reminder whispers, urging us to revive,
Our planet's health, and make our future live.
