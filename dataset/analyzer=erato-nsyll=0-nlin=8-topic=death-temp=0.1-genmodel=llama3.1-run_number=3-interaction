 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness falls the final night
A silence that is endless and bright
The heart that beats no longer free
A life that's lost, a memory to be

The weight of grief upon our chest
A sorrow that will never rest
The passing of time, a fleeting thought
A moment's pause before we're brought
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
