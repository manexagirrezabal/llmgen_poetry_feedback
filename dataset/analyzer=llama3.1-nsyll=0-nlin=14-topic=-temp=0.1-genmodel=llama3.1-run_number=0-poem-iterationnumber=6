Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams, a moment to fulfill

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours flow
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall
And rustles leaves, with an ancient call

In this peaceful hour, I find my rest
My heart beats slow, my soul is blessed
The world may wake, with morning's light
But for now, all is calm and bright
A time to reflect, without a care
In darkness lies a beauty rare
