A crimson leaf falls softly to the ground,
Where golden sunlight paints the fading day.
A gentle breeze whispers secrets all around,
As summer's warmth begins to melt away.

The air grows crisp, with scents of wood and pine,
And squirrels prepare their winter's hidden store.
Birdsong fades, replaced by twilight's chime,
As nature slumbers, hushed at heaven's door.

Stars begin to shimmer in the night,
Diamonds scattered on a velvet sky.
The moon ascends, a beacon soft and bright,
Guiding dreams as weary souls lie nigh.

A hush descends, a stillness fills the air,
And autumn whispers tales beyond compare.
