A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans we hope to find.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that can be bought,
And futures built on promises embraced.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks the path of those who strive and yearn.
A symbol of success, a place to meet,
The world outside, where lessons we must learn.

So clasp it tight, this case of metal sheen,
And face the day, with purpose ever keen.
