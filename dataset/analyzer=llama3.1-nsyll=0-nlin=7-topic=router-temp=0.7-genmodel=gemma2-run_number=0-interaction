 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting one and all.
Through wires spun and signals in the air,
It weaves a web, a digital affair.
From distant shores to screens within our reach,
It grants access, knowledge, and speech.
A modern marvel, guiding bits along.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️
