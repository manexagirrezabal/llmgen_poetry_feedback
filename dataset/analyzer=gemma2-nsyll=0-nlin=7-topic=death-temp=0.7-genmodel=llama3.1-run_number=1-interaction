 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent whispers in the night
Death's dark shadow takes its flight
A fleeting life, a final breath
Fading light, eternal sleep
 Memories linger, tears to shed
The void remains, where love once spread
Eternal silence, peaceful end
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope the poem captures the somber and reflective tone that you were looking for. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
