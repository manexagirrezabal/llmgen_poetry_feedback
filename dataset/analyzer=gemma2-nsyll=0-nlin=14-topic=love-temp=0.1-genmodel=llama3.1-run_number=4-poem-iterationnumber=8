Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
A beacon in the dark of night.
It warms the heart and soothes the soul,
A feeling that makes us whole.

With every touch, it sets us free,
A sense of joy that's meant to be.
In love's sweet arms, we find our peace,
A place where worries cease.

Love's a gift from above so true,
A treasure that forever shines through.
It brings us closer, hand in hand,
Together standing on common land.

Through life's ups and downs, it stands the test,
And guides us forward to love's best.
