 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.
Forgotten meals, a broken toy,
Lost dreams discarded, cast to destroy.
Mountains rise of what we've used,
A silent testament, abused.
Will Earth forgive our careless ways? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
