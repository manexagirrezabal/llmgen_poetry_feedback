A briefcase, sturdy, leather-bound,
Holds dreams and schemes within its ground.
From boardroom battles to coffee's haze,
It travels with you through life's maze.

Contracts signed, ambitions bold,
Within its clasp, stories unfold.
A silent witness to every deal,
To triumphs won, and secrets revealed.

A symbol of power, or just a guide?
A faithful companion, by your side.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so tall,
A constant presence, answering your call.
