 > assistant: Sunlight spills through leaves of green,
A gentle breeze, a rustling scene.
Birdsong fills the air so bright,
Dancing flowers in warm sunlight.
A babbling brook, a crystal stream,
Whispers secrets, a peaceful dream.
Nature's beauty, a wondrous sight,
Filling hearts with pure delight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
