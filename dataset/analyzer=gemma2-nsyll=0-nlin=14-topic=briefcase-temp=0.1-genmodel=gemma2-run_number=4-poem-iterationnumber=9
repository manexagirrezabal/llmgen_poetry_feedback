A briefcase, sturdy, leather-clad and brown,
Holds secrets whispered, hopes that drift around.
From boardroom meetings to coffee shop's embrace,
It travels with you, at your steady pace.

Within its depths, a world of paper lies,
Contracts signed, beneath ambitious eyes.
A silent witness to every deal made bold,
And stories whispered, secrets yet untold.

A symbol of power, or just a guide?
A faithful companion, by your side.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so true,
A constant presence, guiding you anew.
