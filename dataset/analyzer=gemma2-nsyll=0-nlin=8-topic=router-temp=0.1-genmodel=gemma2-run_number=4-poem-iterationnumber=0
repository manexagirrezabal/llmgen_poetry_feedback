A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that gleam.

It guides the flow, a tireless guide,
Through networks vast, where secrets hide.
A humble box, yet power it wields,
The router reigns, its purpose sealed.
