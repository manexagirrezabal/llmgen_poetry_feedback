 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now trash sets free.
Bottles and cans, a tangled mess,
Forgotten wrappers, a careless caress.
Landfills groan, a silent plea,
For mindful choices, for you and me.
Reduce, reuse, recycle's call,
To heal the Earth, before its fall. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
