 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A final breath, a whispered sigh,
The curtain falls, the stars reply.
A silent sleep, a darkened room,
Where echoes fade and shadows loom.
No pain remains, no fear to hold,
Just peace profound, a story told.
In stillness vast, the soul takes flight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
