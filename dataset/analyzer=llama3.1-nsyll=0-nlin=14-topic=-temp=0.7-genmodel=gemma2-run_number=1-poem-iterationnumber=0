The moon hangs heavy, silver in the night,
A silent witness to the world asleep.
Stars like diamonds, scattered with their light,
Across a canvas dark and vast and deep.

The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
A gentle lullaby for weary souls.
And shadows dance upon the frosted breeze,
As darkness claims its nightly, quiet role.

But even in this stillness, hope remains,
A flicker bright that dares to face the dawn.
For light will conquer, breaking night's chains,
And bring a new day, freshly born.

So let us rest, beneath the moonlit sky,
And dream of brighter futures, yet to be nigh.
