A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded, and hopes set free.
Tin cans and bottles, a symphony of waste,
Forgotten treasures, their beauty erased.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and broken, in the fading light.
Food scraps and remnants, a feast for decay,
A silent reminder of what we betray.

The earth groans beneath this burden so vast,
A future uncertain, shadows cast.
Can we mend our ways, before it's too late?
Recycle and reuse, before sealed is our fate.

Let's turn the tide, with conscious intent,
And build a world where garbage is spent.
