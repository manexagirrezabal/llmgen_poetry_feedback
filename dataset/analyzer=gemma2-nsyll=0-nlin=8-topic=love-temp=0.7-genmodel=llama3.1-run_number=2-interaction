 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A tender kiss that makes our heart whole.

In love's sweet arms, we find our peace,
A place to rest where worries cease.
With every beat, our love will grow,
Forever entwined, our hearts will glow.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
