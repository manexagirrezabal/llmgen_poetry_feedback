 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, a fiery, golden hue,
Painting the clouds with streaks of pink and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves anew,
As twilight falls, and shadows softly spread.

The crickets chirp their evening serenade,
While fireflies dance, like stars upon the ground.
A silver moon ascends, a silent raid,
Casting its glow on fields and trees around.

The scent of pine and earth fills every space,
A symphony of nature, calm and deep.
In this embrace, worries gently erase,
And weary souls find solace in their sleep.

So let us pause and marvel at the sight,
Nature's beauty, a beacon shining bright.
