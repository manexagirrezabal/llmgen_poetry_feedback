The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds with hues of gold and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through branches high,
As shadows lengthen, secrets softly spread.

The world grows still, a hush descends on all,
Except the crickets chirping their sweet song.
Stars begin to glimmer, answering the call,
Of twilight's embrace, where dreams belong.

A silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Guiding lost souls through the velvet night.
And in this stillness, peace begins to lie,
A tranquil haven, bathed in ethereal light.

So let us rest, beneath the starry dome,
And find solace in this peaceful, quiet home.
