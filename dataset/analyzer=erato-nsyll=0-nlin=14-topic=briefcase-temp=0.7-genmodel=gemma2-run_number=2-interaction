 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp so tight,
It holds the weight of dreams and day's long fight.
Within its depths, reports and plans reside,
A universe compressed, where futures hide.

From boardroom wars to coffee shop debates,
It walks beside you, sealing hopeful fates.
A silent witness to ambition's gleam,
A steady anchor in a hurried stream.

Its battered corners tell a story old,
Of meetings kept and victories untold.
But when the day is done, its grip will ease,
And secrets safe within will find their peace.

So close the latch, and let it rest awhile,
A humble vessel, holding dreams of style. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
