 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh,
A journey ends beneath the sky.
No more the sun, nor moonlit night,
Only silence, and endless light.
A tapestry woven, thread by thread,
Now gently laid, upon its bed.
Memories linger, faint and sweet,
In hearts that grieve, and souls that meet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Let me know if I can create anything else for you. ğŸ˜Š
