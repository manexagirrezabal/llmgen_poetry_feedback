In hidden corners, it does reside
A device so small, yet networks divide
Its purpose is to direct and guide the way
For data to flow, night and day

With wires and signals, it's in control
Directing packets, with a careful roll
Through Ethernet ports, it takes its stand
Connecting devices, across this digital land

It's a quiet worker, without a sound
Doing its job, without a single bound
But when it fails, the network does too
And chaos erupts, for me and you

So let us appreciate, this humble friend
The router that connects, until the very end
