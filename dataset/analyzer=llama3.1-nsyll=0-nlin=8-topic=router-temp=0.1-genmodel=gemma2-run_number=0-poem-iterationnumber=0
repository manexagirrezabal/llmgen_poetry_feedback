A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Through wires and waves, it guides the flow,
Of thoughts and images, to and fro.
A hub of networks, vast and wide,
Where information freely does reside.
The router hums, a constant beat,
Keeping us linked, from head to feet.
