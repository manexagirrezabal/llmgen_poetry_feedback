 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, for all to know

The world is hushed, in quiet peace
As darkness reigns, with gentle release
The trees stand tall, like sentinels of old
Their leaves rustling softly, young and bold

In this still hour, the heart can roam
Free from the din, of a busy home
Where worries fade, like morning dew
And calm descends, with a peaceful hue

The night's dark veil, a mystery keeps
A time for dreams, where secrets creep
