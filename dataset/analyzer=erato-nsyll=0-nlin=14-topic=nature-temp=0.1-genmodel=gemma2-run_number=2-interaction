 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap 'neath the willow's shade,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And nature's symphony is gently played.

The stars emerge, like diamonds scattered bright,
Across the velvet canvas of the night,
And moonbeams bathe the world in silvery light,
A peaceful hush descends, serene and right.

In nature's embrace, our souls find rest,
A sanctuary where worries cease to test. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
