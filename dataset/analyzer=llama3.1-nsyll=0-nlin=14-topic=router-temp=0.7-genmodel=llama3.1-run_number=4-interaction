 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it sits so fine,
A humble hero, always on my mind.
The router's work, behind the scenes I see,
Connecting all, for you and me.

It routes the traffic, with speed and care,
 Ensuring access, beyond compare.
A steady heartbeat, in the digital space,
Keeping our connections, in perfect pace.

With wireless waves, it spreads its might,
Giving us freedom, day and night.
Through cables strong, or air so free,
The router's power, is what we see.

In every home, a quiet friend indeed,
Guiding data paths, with precision and speed.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers to your liking. If you have any other requests or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
