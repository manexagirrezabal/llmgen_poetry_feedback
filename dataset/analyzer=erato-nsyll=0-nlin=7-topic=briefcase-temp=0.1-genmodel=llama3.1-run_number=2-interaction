 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents, one and all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
It holds the keys to success and fate,
A symbol of power, a tool to create.
In its depths, the future is carefully made.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
