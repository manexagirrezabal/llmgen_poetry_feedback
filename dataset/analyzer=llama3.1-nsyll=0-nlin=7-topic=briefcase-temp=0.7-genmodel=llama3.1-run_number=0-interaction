 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and leather briefcase lies still,
Its contents hidden from prying eyes.
A symbol of success, or so it would seem,
But to one person, just a burdensome dream.
It holds papers, pens, and endless stress,
A constant companion on life's messy quest,
A reminder of the daily grind's weight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
