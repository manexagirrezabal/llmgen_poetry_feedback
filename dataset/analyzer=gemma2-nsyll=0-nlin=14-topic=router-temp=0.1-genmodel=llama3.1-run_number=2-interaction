 > assistant: In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across the lands
It navigates the net, with skill and art
Directing packets, to their designated heart

In homes and offices, it's a constant friend
A steadfast companion, till the very end
It adapts and adjusts, to changing needs
A flexible guide, through digital deeds

With Wi-Fi waves, it spreads its gentle might
Connecting all devices, in plain sight
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
