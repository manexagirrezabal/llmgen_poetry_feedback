 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Trash cans overflowing high
Fumes of rot and decay in the sky
Rotten food and moldy bread
The stench of waste that's left unsaid
Plastic bags and discarded things
Polluting earth with its dirty rings
A mountain grows, a problem deep
Human carelessness starts to creep
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
