A silent hush descends, the world grows still,
As life's bright flame flickers and starts to chill.
The final breath escapes on whispered sighs,
And weary eyes close 'neath starlit skies.

But memories bloom like flowers in the night,
Reflecting moments bathed in warm sunlight.
Though tears may fall, and sorrow fills the air,
Love's gentle touch brings solace and repair.

For death is not an ending, but a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
And though we grieve, their essence will remain,
A timeless echo whispering love's refrain.
