 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a whispered past.
No longer bound by earthly ties,
A soul ascends to starry skies.
But memories linger, warm and bright,
Guiding stars in darkest night.
Though death may claim our mortal shell,
Love's echo lives, a timeless spell. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
