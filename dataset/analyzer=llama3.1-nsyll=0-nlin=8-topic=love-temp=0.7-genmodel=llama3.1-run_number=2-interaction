 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch, a whispered tone,
A feeling that makes our souls feel at home.

It's the laughter, the tears, the memories we share,
The moments that make our love beyond compare.
With every beat of our loving heart,
Our love will shine, never to depart.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that resonates with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
