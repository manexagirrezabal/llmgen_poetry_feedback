In quiet rooms it quietly resides
A hum of power that never subsides
It connects and routes with speed so fine
A bridge between devices in our digital shrine

Its antennas reach for signals far and wide
Receiving data streams with precision inside
IP addresses assigned with a careful hand
Directing traffic through the digital land

With Wi-Fi signals strong, it's always on display
Connecting laptops, phones, and tablets all day
Through the noise of life, it keeps its steady pace
A constant presence in our digital space

In the shadows of our homes, it quietly does its part
Keeping us connected to this digital heart.
