 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright,
A midnight breeze that stirs the night.
Stars up high in celestial show,
A world asleep, yet darkness glows.
The shadows dance upon the wall,
As silence falls and all is still,
In this quiet hour, my heart stands tall.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
