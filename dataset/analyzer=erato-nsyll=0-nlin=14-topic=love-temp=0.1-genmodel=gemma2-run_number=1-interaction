 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

With every beat, their love grows ever strong,
A melody of passion, sweet and long.
In every glance, a universe untold,
A story written, never to grow old.

Love's tapestry, woven with care and grace,
A timeless treasure, time cannot erase. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
