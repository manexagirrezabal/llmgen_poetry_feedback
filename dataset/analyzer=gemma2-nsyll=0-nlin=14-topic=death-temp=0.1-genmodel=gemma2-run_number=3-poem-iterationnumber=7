The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just silent peace, where shadows softly come.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories bloom, within the soul's behest.
A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Unfurls in dreams, where time and space entwine.

Though darkness claims us all, in life's grand scheme,
Love's echo lingers, a vibrant, flowing stream.
And though we part, our spirits intertwine,
In cosmic dance, forever yours and mine. 
A final verse, the story gently told,
Leaving behind a love that will unfold.
Like stars that shine, through darkness ever bold.
