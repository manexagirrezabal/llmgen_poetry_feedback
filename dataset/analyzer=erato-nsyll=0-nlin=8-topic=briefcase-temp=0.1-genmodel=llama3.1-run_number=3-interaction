 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather case, worn and so fine,
Holds secrets and papers that are mine.
It's carried with care, through day and night,
A symbol of work, a constant sight.

Its contents are varied, some old and new,
 Contracts and reports, all waiting to break through.
The briefcase is trusted, a faithful friend indeed,
A loyal companion, in every professional need.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create the poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
