In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms to the sky
Receiving and sending, with a digital sigh
It navigates the web, with precision and care
Directing packets home, with no time to spare

In the background, it works tirelessly night
A guardian of networks, shining with delight
Through firewalls and filters, it carefully guides
Protecting the flow, with its digital pride

With each new connection, its power grows strong
A silent sentinel, where data flows all day long
