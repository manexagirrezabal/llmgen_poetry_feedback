 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather briefcase, sturdy and strong
Holds the weight of important things all day long
Documents and files, carefully arranged with care
A symbol of professionalism, beyond compare
The handle worn smooth, from frequent use and stress
It carries the weight of responsibility, I must confess
A faithful companion, to the office and success
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
