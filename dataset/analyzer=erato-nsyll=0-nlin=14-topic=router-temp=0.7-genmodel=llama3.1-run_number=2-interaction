 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A humble hero, with wires inside
Connecting devices, with speed and might
A router's purpose, in plain sight

It transmits signals, with precision and care
Allowing data to flow, without a single snare
Through its labyrinthine paths, information strays
To reach the world beyond, in endless ways

With firmware updates, it stays ahead of time
Protecting networks, from cybercrime's dark prime
A sentinel guardian, watching over the land
Keeping connections secure, with an iron hand

In the background, it works tirelessly night and day
Maintaining order, as data flows its way
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about routers for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
