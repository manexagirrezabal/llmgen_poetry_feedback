A hush descends, the world grows still and cold,
The beating heart, a rhythm hushed and gone.
No longer stories whispered, brave and bold,
Just empty silence where laughter once had dawn.

But is it truly ending, or a start?
A passage through the veil to realms unseen?
Where whispers dance and shadows play their part,
And memories bloom, forever evergreen.

Though tears may fall, and sorrow grip the soul,
Love's gentle echo lingers in the air.
A whispered promise, making spirits whole,
That life endures beyond this earthly snare.

So sleep now peaceful, journey to the light,
Where stars ignite and darkness turns to bright.
