 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets the soul on fire,
A feeling so pure, it never will tire.

With every beat of our loving heart,
We share a connection that never departs.
In love's sweet arms, we find our peaceful place,
Together forever, in a warm and endless space.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that captures the beauty of love for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
