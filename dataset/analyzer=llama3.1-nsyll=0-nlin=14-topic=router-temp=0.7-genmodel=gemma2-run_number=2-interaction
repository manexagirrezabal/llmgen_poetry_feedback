 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of wires, a silent guide,
The router hums, a digital tide.
Connecting worlds, unseen and vast,
From homes to servers, holding fast.

Packets fly, a fleeting dance,
Through ethernet trails, a vibrant trance.
Wi-Fi whispers, signals spread,
Across the airwaves, stories are read.

A gateway built of silicon heart,
Sharing knowledge, playing its part.
Streaming movies, calls that chime,
Connecting lives, transcending time.

The router's pulse, a steady beat,
Keeping us linked, from head to feet. 




 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, a box of might,
The router hums, day and through the night.
It weaves a web, invisible and wide,
Connecting homes where dreams reside.

Through wires thin, and waves that soar,
Information flows, forevermore.
From streaming shows to emails sent,
Its tireless work, on us is spent.

A digital bridge, a modern art,
Connecting souls, playing its part.
No longer bound by distance's hold,
The router's magic, stories told.

A vital pulse, a steady stream,
Keeping us linked, in life's grand scheme. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help craft the poem for you.  ðŸ˜Š
