A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now trash sets free.
Forgotten wrappers, bottles tossed aside,
A silent testament to what we hide.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A future choked by what has been.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a legacy, clean and grand.
