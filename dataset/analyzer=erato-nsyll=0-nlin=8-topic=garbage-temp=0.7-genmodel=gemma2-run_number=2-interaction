 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, tossed and strewn,
Plastic bottles, wrappers, paper moon.
Leftover meals, forgotten dreams,
Litter scattered, broken beams.

A festering mound, a noxious blight,
Consumed by creatures in the night.
Nature's cry, a silent plea,
For mindful hands to set us free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
