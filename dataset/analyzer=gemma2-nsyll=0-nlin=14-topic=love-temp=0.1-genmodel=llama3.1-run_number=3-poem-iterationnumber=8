Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
It's a bond between two souls so true,
A connection that forever shines through.

With every kiss, with every tender sigh,
Love grows stronger, reaching for the sky.
Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
A constant heartbeat that forever finds rest.

In love's sweet arms, we find our peaceful nest,
Where hearts are safe and love is at its best.
