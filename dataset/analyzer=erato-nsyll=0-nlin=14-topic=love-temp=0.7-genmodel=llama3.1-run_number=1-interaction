 > assistant: Love's gentle touch ignites the flame,
Warming hearts and soothing all pain.
A whispered promise in the dead of night,
A tender kiss that feels like pure delight.

With every beat, our hearts entwine,
In perfect harmony, a love divine.
The world may fade, but love remains,
A constant flame that burns through life's refrains.

Through laughter and tears, we stand as one,
Our love a shelter from the stormy sun.
In each other's eyes, our souls take flight,
And in the silence, our love shines bright.

Love's beauty is a work of art divine,
A masterpiece that forever will entwine.
 > human: Thank you!
