A silent hush descends upon the air,
As life's last breath escapes in whispered sigh.
The eyes that once held laughter, now stare blankly,
A canvas painted with a final dye.

The body still, a vessel laid to rest,
Its journey through this world has come to end.
But memories linger, like a gentle guest,
Reminding us of love that knows no bend.

Though tears may fall and grief may fill the heart,
Let not despair consume your fading light.
For death is but a transition, a new start,
Where souls ascend to realms of endless night.

Embrace the peace that comes with letting go,
And find solace in the seeds that life did sow.
