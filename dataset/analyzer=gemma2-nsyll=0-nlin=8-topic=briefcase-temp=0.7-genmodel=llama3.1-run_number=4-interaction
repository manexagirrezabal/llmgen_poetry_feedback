 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather briefcase, worn and old
Carries dreams, of stories untold
Its clasps creak open with a sigh
Revealing files, that touch the sky

It holds the weight, of promises made
And deadlines kept, in a world displayed
Through crowded streets, it's often seen
A symbol of power, or so it seems
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
