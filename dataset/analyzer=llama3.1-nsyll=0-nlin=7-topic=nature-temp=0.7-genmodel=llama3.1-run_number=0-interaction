 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Their gentle rustle through the night.
The river flows with calm delight,
Reflecting stars in all its light.
Nature's beauty is a wondrous sight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you want another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
