Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In each other's arms, we'll find our home.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together forever, under the bright sun.

Love is a journey, not a destination,
Where every step leads to a new creation.
It's a bond that strengthens with each passing day,
A love so strong, it chases all fears away.

In your eyes, my heart finds its home,
With you, I am never alone.
