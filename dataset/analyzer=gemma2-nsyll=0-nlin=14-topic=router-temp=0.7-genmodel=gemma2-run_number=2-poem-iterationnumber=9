A silent sentinel, a box unseen,
It weaves a web where data's king and queen.
Through wires fine, a constant hum it sends,
Connecting worlds where knowledge transcends.

From distant lands to screens aglow so bright,
It carries voices through the day and night.
A gateway built on silicon's embrace,
It grants us access, time and space erase. 

No longer bound by distance or despair,
We share our thoughts, our dreams, beyond compare.
The router stands, a hero in disguise,
Guiding connections with its digital eyes.
