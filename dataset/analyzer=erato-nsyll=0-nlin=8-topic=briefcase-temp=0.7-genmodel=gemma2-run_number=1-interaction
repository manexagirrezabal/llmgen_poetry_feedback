 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sentinel of leather, sleek and brown,
It holds the secrets whispered in a town.
Deals struck, dreams spun, ambitions vast,
Within its clasp, futures come to pass.
From boardroom battles to coffee's steam,
It walks beside, a silent, constant stream.
A symbol weighty, filled with hopes and fears,
The briefcase journeys, through passing years.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
