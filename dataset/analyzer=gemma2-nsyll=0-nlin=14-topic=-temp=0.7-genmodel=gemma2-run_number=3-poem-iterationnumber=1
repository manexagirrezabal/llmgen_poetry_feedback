The twilight hour, a soft and gentle sigh,
As golden hues paint clouds across the sky.
A robin's song, a final note so sweet,
Before the world surrenders to retreat.

The trees stand tall, their branches reaching high,
To catch the last rays of the fading light.
A whisper stirs, a rustling in the rye,
As shadows lengthen in the coming night.

Stars begin to peek through velvet skies,
And fireflies dance, with tiny twinkling eyes.
The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting its glow upon the world below.

Silence descends, a hush that fills the air,
A promise whispered of dreams beyond compare.
