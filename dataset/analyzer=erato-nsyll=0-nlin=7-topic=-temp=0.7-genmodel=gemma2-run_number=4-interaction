 > assistant: The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
Painting clouds in hues of bliss.
A gentle breeze whispers through trees,
Carrying secrets on the breeze.
Stars begin to softly gleam,
A symphony of light's soft dream.
Night descends, a velvet shroud. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š I hope you enjoyed the poem.
