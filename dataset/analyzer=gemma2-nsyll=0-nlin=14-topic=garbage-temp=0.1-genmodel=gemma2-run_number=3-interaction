 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes set free.
Tin cans and bottles, a symphony of waste,
Forgotten treasures, a future erased.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and broken, lost to the night.
Food scraps and remnants, a feast for decay,
A silent reminder of what we betray.

The earth groans beneath this burden so vast,
A testament to our greed that will last.
But hope flickers still, in a seed's gentle rise,
To mend what is broken, before it all dies.

Let us choose wisely, with purpose and care,
For the future we build, and the air that we share.

 > assistant: A plastic tide rises, a choking embrace,
Where dreams are discarded and time leaves no trace.
Tin cans and bottles, a chorus of waste,
Forgotten desires, a future erased.
