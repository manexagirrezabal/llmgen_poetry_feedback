 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings whisper through the day
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land

With whispered secrets, he steals away
The light of life, in endless gray
No sound is made, no alarm is raised
As death's dark veil its victims sways

In final sleep, the heart doth cease
And all that lived, in stillness freeze
 Memories remain, a bittersweet refrain
Echoes of love, and joy, and pain

Yet even death, cannot stay his hand
For life's great cycle, must unfold again
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
