 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.

Garbage piles up, side by side.

A messy sight that brings us kings.
Of pollution's heavy, dirty toll,
The earth cries out for a cleaner role.
Let's sort and recycle, take control.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
