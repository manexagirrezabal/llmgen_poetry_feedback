A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets close, in hurried grasp.
From boardroom walls to city streets,
It carries dreams and anxious feats.
A silent witness, sleek and strong,
To deals made swift, where right meets wrong.
The weight of words, the burden borne,
Within its depths, a future sworn.
