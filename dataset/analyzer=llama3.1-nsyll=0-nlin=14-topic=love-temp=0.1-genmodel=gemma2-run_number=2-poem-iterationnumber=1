A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A spark ignites, dispelling all the gloom.
Two hearts entwined, a rhythm soft and low,
A silent language only love can know.

With gentle touch, a world begins to bloom,
Where dreams take flight and banish every doom.
Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.

A sanctuary found in each other's eyes,
Where trust resides and hope forever flies.
Two souls united, destinies aligned,
In love's embrace, true happiness we find.
