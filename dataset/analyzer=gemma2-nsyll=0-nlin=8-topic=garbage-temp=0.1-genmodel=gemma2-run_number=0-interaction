 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Bottles and boxes, a tangled mess,
A testament to our excess, I confess.
The earth groans under this weighty load,
A silent plea, a desperate code.
Let's mend our ways, reduce and reuse,
For a cleaner future, let's choose to choose. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
