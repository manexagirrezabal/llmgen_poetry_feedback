A silent curtain drawn across the stage,
The final act, a whispered, fading sigh.
No more the laughter, no more turn of page,
Just shadows dancing 'neath a moonlit sky.
The heart that beat, now stilled and cold as stone,
The eyes that sparkled, dimmed beyond repair.
A life once vibrant, overthrown, unknown
To realms where whispers mingle with despair.
But fear not, friend, for death is but a door,
That leads to paths we cannot yet perceive.
A tapestry of stars, forevermore,
Where souls transcend and find sweet reprieve.
Though tears may fall, and grief may claim its hold,
Love's embers glow, a story yet untold.
