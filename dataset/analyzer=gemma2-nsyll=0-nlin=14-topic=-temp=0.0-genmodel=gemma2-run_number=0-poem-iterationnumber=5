A crimson leaf falls, twirling in the breeze,
A whisper of autumn, among rustling trees.
Sunlight slants through branches, golden and bright,
Painting shadows long, in fading daylight.

The air grows crisp, with a hint of frost's kiss,
As nature prepares for winter's silent bliss.
Squirrels gather acorns, their cheeks full and round,
While geese fly southward, on wings that resound.

A symphony of colors, vibrant and bold,
Nature's masterpiece, before winter takes hold.
So let us savor this season's gentle grace,
And find beauty in time's fleeting embrace.
