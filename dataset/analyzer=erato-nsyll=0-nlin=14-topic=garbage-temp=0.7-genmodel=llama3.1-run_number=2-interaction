 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twisted heaps, it lies in wait
A smelly mess that's hard to abate
From food to plastic, it's thrown away
A careless habit that's here to stay

In landfills deep, it slowly rots
Releasing fumes that choke the plots
The earth cries out for a cleaner way
But humans seem to turn a blind eye each day

The oceans choke on discarded plastic fate
As creatures suffocate in a sea of hate
The problem grows, and so does our shame
For the waste we make, and the blame we claim

We must act now, before it's too late
And find a way to recycle, create.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about garbage for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
