 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can never fade,
A bond between two souls forever made.

With every kiss, with every sigh,
Our love grows stronger, reaching for the sky.
Through laughter and tears, we stand as one,
Forever entwined, our love has just begun.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
