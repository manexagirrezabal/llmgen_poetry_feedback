A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam.

It guides the flow, a traffic master bold,
Ensuring stories reach both young and old.
A humble hero, its purpose untold,
The router weaves connections, strong and cold.
