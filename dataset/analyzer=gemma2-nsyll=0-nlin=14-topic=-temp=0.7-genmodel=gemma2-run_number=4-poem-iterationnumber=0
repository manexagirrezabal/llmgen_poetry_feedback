The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds with hues of amber bright.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so high,
As shadows lengthen in the fading light.

Stars begin to peek, diamonds in the night,
Their distant glimmer, a celestial guide.
The moon ascends, a beacon soft and white,
Casting its spell where secrets softly hide.

The world grows still, a hush descends on all,
A symphony of crickets fills the air.
Tranquility embraces, answering the call,
Of slumber sweet, beyond compare.

So let us rest, beneath the starry sky,
And dream of wonders as the hours fly.
