A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds, a digital machine.
Packets dance through wires, swift and bright,
Guiding data through the day and night.
From web to game, from call to chat,
It weaves a web, where all can chat.
The router hums, a constant friend,
A vital link, till the very end.
