 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, stark and gray,
Forgotten remnants of yesterday.
Plastic whispers, paper sighs,
Metal groans beneath tired skies.
A feast for pests, a stench so strong,
Where beauty fades and life goes wrong.
A silent plea, will we heed its call? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  

Do you have any other creative requests?  I'd love to help!  âœ¨
