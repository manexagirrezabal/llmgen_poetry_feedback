 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls of networking fame,
A router stands, with circuits ablaze.
It routes the data, with speed and might,
Through tangled wires, in endless night.

Its processor hums, a gentle song,
As it directs packets, all day long.
With algorithms keen, it finds its way,
Through cyberspace, in a digital bay.

In homes and offices, it's a common sight,
A box of wonder, with flashing light.
It connects the world, in an instant's span,
And brings us closer, to the digital plan.

With a gentle whoosh, it routes them through,
And keeps our networks, forever anew.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about routers for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
