 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A mountain high, a dismal fact.

The smell is foul, the sight is grim,
A reflection of our careless whim.
We use and toss, without a care,
Leaving behind a toxic snare.

Our planet suffers, we must see,
And change our ways, for you and me.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
