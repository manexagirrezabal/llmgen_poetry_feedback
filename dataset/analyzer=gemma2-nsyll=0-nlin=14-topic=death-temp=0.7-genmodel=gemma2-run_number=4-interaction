 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent shroud upon the weary eyes,
A final breath, a whisper in the night.
The sun descends, and darkness gently lies
Across the face that once held burning light.

No more the laughter, music, or the dance,
Only the stillness of eternal sleep.
A fading memory, a fleeting chance
To hold a hand, a secret to keep.

But though the body rests in earthly clay,
The spirit soars on wings unseen and free.
And love remains, a beacon in the gray,
A guiding star for all eternity.

So let us grieve, yet find solace in this truth:
That life transcends the boundaries of youth.

 > assistant: A quiet hush falls on the world at last,
The beating heart grows still, its rhythm ceased.
A shadow creeps across the fading past,
And weary eyes find final, peaceful rest.

No more the bustling day, the sun's bright gaze,
But gentle twilight whispers in the breeze.
A tapestry of moments fades and sways,
As life surrenders to eternal ease.

Yet memories linger, like a whispered name,
A spark of love that time cannot erase.
And though the body sleeps, untouched by flame,
The soul ascends, to find its rightful place.

 > assistant: The final curtain falls upon the stage,
A silent hush descends where laughter played.
The vibrant colors fade into gray,
And shadows lengthen as the light gives way.

No more the heartbeat's steady, rhythmic drum,
No whispered secrets shared beneath the sun.
A gentle breeze sighs through the empty air,
As if to say, "Life's journey now is rare."

But in the tapestry of time's grand design,
Each thread a memory, forever thine.
Though mortal shells return to dust below,
The spirit soars on wings where love may flow.

 > assistant: The sun descends, a final golden kiss,
Upon the world, now cloaked in twilight's bliss.
A quiet hush falls over fields of green,
As nature sleeps, a tranquil, peaceful scene.

No more the bustling day, its hurried pace,
Just gentle breezes whispering through this place.
The weary soul finds solace in the night,
Released from burdens, bathed in soft moonlight.

A final breath escapes, a whispered sigh,
As stars ignite across the velvet sky.
And though the body rests in slumber deep,
The spirit journeys where true wonders sleep.

In realms of light, beyond our mortal sight,
