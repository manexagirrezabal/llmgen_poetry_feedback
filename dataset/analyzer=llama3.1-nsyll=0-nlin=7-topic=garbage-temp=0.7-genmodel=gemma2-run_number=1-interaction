 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, piled high and wide,
Plastic bottles, paper, with nowhere to hide.
Tarnished cans, once bright, now dull and gray,
Food scraps decay, a stench fills the day.
Landfills grow, consuming our land,
A consequence of waste, out of hand.
Let's mend our ways, before it's too late. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š  I hope you liked the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
