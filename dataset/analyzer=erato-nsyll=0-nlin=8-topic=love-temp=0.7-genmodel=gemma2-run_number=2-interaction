 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and whispered dreams,
In loving arms, life truly gleams.
Through storms they stand, forever bound,
A sacred vow, on solid ground.
Love's gentle touch, a healing grace,
Time cannot dim, love's warm embrace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
