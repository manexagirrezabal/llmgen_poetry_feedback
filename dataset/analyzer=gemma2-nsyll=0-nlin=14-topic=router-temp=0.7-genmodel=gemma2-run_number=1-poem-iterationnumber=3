A silent sentinel, unassuming in its form,
The router hums, weathering each digital storm.
Packets flow like rivers, through circuits deep and wide,
Connecting distant shores, where dreams reside.

It bridges gaps, transcends the earthly bound,
With unseen tendrils, knowledge is found.
From whispered chats to video calls so clear,
It weaves a tapestry of voices, drawing near.

A modern marvel, small but mighty in its way,
Guiding information through each passing day.
So raise a glass to this unsung hero bold,
The router's magic, a story yet untold.
