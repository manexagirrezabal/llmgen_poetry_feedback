In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, its story told
 Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's breeze

In darkness, all is made complete
The cycle ends, the journey sweet
No more pain, no more strife or fear
Just eternal rest, and peaceful sleep here

But even in death, a spark remains
A memory of life, its love and pains
