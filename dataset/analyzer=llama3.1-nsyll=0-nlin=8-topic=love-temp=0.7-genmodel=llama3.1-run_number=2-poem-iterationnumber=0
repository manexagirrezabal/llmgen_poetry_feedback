Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch, a whispered tone,
A feeling that makes our souls feel at home.

It's the laughter, the tears, the memories we share,
The moments that make our love beyond compare.
With every beat of our loving heart,
Our love will shine, never to depart.
