 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon the velvet cloak of night.
Stars whisper secrets, soft and clear,
As shadows dance in pale moonlight.

A lone wolf howls, a mournful cry,
Across the hills, a haunting sound.
While owls take flight, beneath the sky,
On silent wings, they softly bound.

The world sleeps deep, a tranquil scene,
Where dreams unfold and worries cease.
A gentle breeze, a whispered dream,
Brings solace and a moment's peace.

And in this quiet, hushed embrace,
Hope blossoms forth with newfound grace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to hear another poem sometime.
