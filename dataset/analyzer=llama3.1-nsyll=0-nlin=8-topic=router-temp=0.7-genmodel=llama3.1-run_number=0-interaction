 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In hidden corners, it does reside
Connecting devices, side by side
A hub of traffic, fast and true
Routing signals, for me and you

With Wi-Fi waves, it does abound
Keeping us online, without a sound
Its humming noise, a constant beat
 Connecting the world, at our feet
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
