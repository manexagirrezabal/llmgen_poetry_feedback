 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight paints the leaves with gold,
A gentle breeze whispers untold,
Flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's symphony, it imbues,
Birdsong fills the air so sweet,
Where life and beauty gently meet,
A tranquil haven, pure and free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
