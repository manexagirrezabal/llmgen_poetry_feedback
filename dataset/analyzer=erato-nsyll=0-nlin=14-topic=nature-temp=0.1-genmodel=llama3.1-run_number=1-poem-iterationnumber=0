The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks reaching high into the light.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its tranquil dream.

The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
A haven for the creatures unseen.
The birds sing sweet, their melodies so bright,
Filling my heart with joy and delight.

In nature's arms, I find my peaceful nest,
Where worries fade and love finds rest.
