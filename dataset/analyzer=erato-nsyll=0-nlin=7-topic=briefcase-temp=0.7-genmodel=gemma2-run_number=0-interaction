 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
Holding secrets, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of deals made, stories told.
It travels paths both far and near,
Bearing burdens, banishing fear.
A briefcase, silent, strong, and true. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š 

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
