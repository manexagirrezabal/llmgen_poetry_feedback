A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, a symphony
Of clinking cans, where sunlight cannot sway.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid haze,
A testament to our insatiable greed.
We fill the earth with what we can't erase,
A legacy of waste, a poisoned seed.

But hope remains, a flicker in the night,
To mend our ways, to choose a different path.
Recycle, reuse, and hold the future tight,
Transforming trash into a vibrant aftermath.

Let's build a world where garbage finds its place,
A cleaner future, with a brighter grace.
