 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A humble case of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and hopes unknown.
Within its depths, contracts finely spun,
And plans that rise like morning's golden sun.

A silent witness to boardroom wars,
Where fortunes shift and ambition roars.
It guards the secrets whispered in the night,
And carries burdens under dim lamplight.

From bustling streets to office sterile halls,
It traverses paths where fate installs
Its twists and turns, its triumphs and its falls.
The briefcase stands, a symbol for us all,
Of journeys taken, victories and thralls. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 13 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A polished shell of leather, sleek and strong,
It holds the weight of futures, right or wrong.
Within its depths, a world of deals untold,
And stories whispered, secrets to behold.

From morning rush to evening's fading light,
It carries burdens, day and through the night.
A silent witness to ambition's climb,
Where victories are won and hearts entwine.

Across the city streets it makes its way,
A symbol of success, come what may.
With every step, a promise on the line,
A testament to dreams, both grand design.

It stands for power, for the will to strive,
The briefcase waits, where fortunes come alive.




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help craft a poem that met your requirements.  Let me know if you have any other creative writing requests. ğŸ˜Š
