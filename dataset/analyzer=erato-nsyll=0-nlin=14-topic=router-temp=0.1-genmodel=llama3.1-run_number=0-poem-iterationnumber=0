In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms so fine
Receiving and sending, in perfect time
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, to the digital thread

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
A beacon calling, to all who claim
To join the network, and be a part of the crew
The router's power, is a wondrous thing anew

In our homes and offices, it's always near
A constant presence, that banishes fear
