 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds, a digital machine.
Packets dance through wires, swift and bright,
Guiding data through the day and night.
From web to game, from call to chat,
It weaves a web, where all can chat.
The router hums, a constant friend,
A vital link, till the very end. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you need any other poems or creative writing pieces.
