 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of magic, humming low,
Connecting worlds, where data flow.
Packets dance, through wires thin,
From screen to screen, a journey within.
Wi-Fi whispers, a silent call,
Devices gather, answering all.
The router reigns, a silent guide,
In digital realms, it does preside. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
