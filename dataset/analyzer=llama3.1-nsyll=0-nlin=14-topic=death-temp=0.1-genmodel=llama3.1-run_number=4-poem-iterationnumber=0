In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings whisper through the day
A silent guest, with solemn face
He comes to claim his appointed place

With gentle touch, or fierce decree
He takes the breath from mortal sea
The heart that beats, now still and cold
The life force fades, like autumn's gold

In darkness deep, where none can see
Death's mystery awaits eternity
A final rest, for weary soul
Where love and tears, no longer whole

And though we mourn, his coming near
Death brings release, from mortal fear
