 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a rigid frame,
A silent witness to ambition's game.
It holds the weight of hopes and dreams,
Of meetings won and passing schemes.
Its polished clasp, a secret key,
Unlocking futures yet to be.
From boardroom floors to bustling streets,
The briefcase marches on, with measured feats. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
