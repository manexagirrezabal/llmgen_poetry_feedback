 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, stories untold.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Love's gentle touch, encompassing all.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand,
Forever bound, a sacred strand.
In love's embrace, we truly stand.
