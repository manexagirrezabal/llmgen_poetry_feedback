 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight paints shadows, stories untold.
A crimson leaf dances on breezes so light,
Autumn's embrace, a breathtaking sight.
Crisp air awakens with scents of decay,
Nature prepares for winter's cold sway.
Beauty lingers, before the frost takes hold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  😊  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  ✨
