Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a whispered promise in the dead of space,
A gentle touch that takes its rightful place.

In tender moments, it reveals its face,
A reflection of our deepest, truest pace.
With every beat, our hearts entwine,
Together dancing to a love divine.

The world may fade, but love remains,
A constant heartbeat that forever sustains.
It's the whispered words in the still of night,
The loving gaze that shines like a guiding light.

Love is the anchor that holds us fast,
A bond that strengthens with each passing cast.
