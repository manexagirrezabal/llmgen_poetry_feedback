 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever understand.

No words are needed, feelings run so deep,
A love that conquers, secrets they will keep.
Forever bound, their destinies aligned,
In each other's arms, true solace they will find.

A tapestry of moments, woven with care,
Love's eternal flame, a treasure to share.
