 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm golden ray,
Nor moonlit dance to end the day.
A journey taken, swift and deep,
Where shadows dance and secrets sleep.
The body rests, the soul takes flight,
Into the endless, starlit night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
