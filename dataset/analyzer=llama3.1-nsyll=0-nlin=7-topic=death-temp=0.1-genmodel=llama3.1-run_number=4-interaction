 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness claims its own,
A final breath, a life overthrown.

Our time on earth, forever blessed.
Fading light, a soul now still.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
