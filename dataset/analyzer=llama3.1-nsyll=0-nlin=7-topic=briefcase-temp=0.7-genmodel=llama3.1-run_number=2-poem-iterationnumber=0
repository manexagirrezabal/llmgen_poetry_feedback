A leather briefcase, sturdy and strong
Holds the weight of important things all day long
Documents and files, carefully arranged with care
A symbol of professionalism, beyond compare
The handle worn smooth, from frequent use and stress
It carries the weight of responsibility, I must confess
A faithful companion, to the office and success
