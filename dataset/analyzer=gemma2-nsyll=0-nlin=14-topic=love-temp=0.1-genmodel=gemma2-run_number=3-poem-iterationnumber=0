A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a love that starts to flow.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A symphony of hearts, a rhythmic beat.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.
With every glance, a universe untold,
A bond unbreakable, a story to unfold.

In quiet moments, whispers in the night,
Love's tender embrace, a beacon burning bright.
Forever bound, through sunshine and through rain,
Two souls as one, love's eternal reign.
