In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A mountain high, a dismal fact.

The smell of rot and decay fills air,
A stench that's hard to bear or share.
In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
But still it leaks, a toxic sight.
We must reduce, reuse, recycle too,
For the earth's sake, what we can do,
And make a change for me and you,
And save our planet, pure and true.
