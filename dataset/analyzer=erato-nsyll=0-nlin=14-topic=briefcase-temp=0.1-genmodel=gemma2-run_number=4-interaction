 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans entwined.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that can be bought,
And futures built on fortunes it embraced.

From bustling streets to quiet office space,
It walks the path of progress, day by day.
A symbol of ambition, time and place,
Where dreams are chased and victories they say.

But empty now, it waits for its return,
To fill with purpose, lessons yet to learn. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
