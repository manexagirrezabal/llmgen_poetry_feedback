A whispered word, a touch so light and warm,
A spark ignites, a flame begins to burn.
Two souls entwined, safe from life's harsh storm,
In each other's gaze, a universe we learn.

Through laughter shared and tears that freely fall,
Love's gentle hand guides us through it all.
A bond unbreakable, standing strong and tall,
A fortress built where hearts can conquer thrall.

With every beat, our love grows ever deep,
A symphony of souls, a promise to keep.
Through changing tides and seasons that may sleep,
Our love will bloom, a treasure we shall reap.
Forever bound, in destinies entwined,
Two hearts as one, a love forever enshrined.
