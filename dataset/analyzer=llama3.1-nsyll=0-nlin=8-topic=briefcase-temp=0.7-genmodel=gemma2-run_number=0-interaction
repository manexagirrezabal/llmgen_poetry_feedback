 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shield, a trusted friend,
Holds secrets close, until the end.
Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of deals and dreams, stories told.
From boardroom bright to coffee's steam,
It carries burdens, lives, and schemes.
A silent witness, strong and bold,
The briefcase stands, a story untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🎶🎨✍️
