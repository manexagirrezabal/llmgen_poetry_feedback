 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain, drawn at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm, golden grace,
Nor moonlit whispers in this place.
A journey taken, swift and deep,
Where shadows dance and secrets sleep.
The body rests, the spirit flies,
Beyond the veil, where truth resides. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
