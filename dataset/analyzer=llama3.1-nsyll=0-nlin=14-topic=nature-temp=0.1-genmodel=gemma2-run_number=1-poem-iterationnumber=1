Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets untold,
Flowers unfurl, a vibrant, colorful scene,
As nature's beauty unfolds.

Birdsong fills the air, a sweet refrain,
Butterflies dance on wings of painted grace,
A babbling brook murmurs, easing every pain,
Reflecting sunlight in its watery embrace.

The scent of pine and earth, a calming blend,
Where worries fade and spirits find their ease,
In nature's arms, a solace without end,
A sanctuary where hearts can truly seize.

Golden rays descend, painting the sky,
Nature's masterpiece, before we say goodbye.
