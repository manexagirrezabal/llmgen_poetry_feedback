 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A gentle touch, a whispered word,
A spark that ignites, unheard.
Two souls entwined, a beating heart,
A love that sets our spirits apart.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
A bond unbreakable, standing tall.
In every glance, a universe bright,
Love's radiant glow, a guiding light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
