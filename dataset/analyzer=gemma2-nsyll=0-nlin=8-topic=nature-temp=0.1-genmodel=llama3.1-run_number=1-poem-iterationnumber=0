The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Dancing in the breeze with gentle might.

The river flows with waters cold,
Reflecting mountains young and old.
The forest floor is carpeted deep,
With wildflowers blooming, secrets keep.
