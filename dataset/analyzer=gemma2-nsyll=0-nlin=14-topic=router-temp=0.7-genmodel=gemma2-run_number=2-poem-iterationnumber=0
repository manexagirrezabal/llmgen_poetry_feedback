A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, its domain serene.
Packets dance within its digital flow,
Connecting worlds where data comes and goes.

Through ether waves, it sends a whispered call,
To screens that gleam, to voices standing tall.
A gateway built on silicon's embrace,
It weaves a tapestry of time and space.

From distant lands, to homes across the street,
It bridges gaps with lightning-fast defeat.
A humble hero, often overlooked,
Yet vital link, its purpose understood.

So let us praise this tireless knight of code,
The router's hum, a symphony bestowed.
