A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It speaks in packets, a language unknown,
Connecting worlds, making data flown.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a tapestry, vibrant and keen.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal to play,
It guides your journey, come what may.

But when it falters, the world slows its pace,
Frustration mounts, a digital disgrace.
A blinking light, a signal so weak,
The internet's lifeline, now hard to seek.

Yet with a reboot, or a simple tweak,
It springs back to life, connections unique.
