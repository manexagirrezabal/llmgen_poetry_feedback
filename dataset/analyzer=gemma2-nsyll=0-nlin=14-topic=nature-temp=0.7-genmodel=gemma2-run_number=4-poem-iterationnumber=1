Sunlight spills on emerald leaves,
A symphony of whispers in the breeze.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant array,
Painting meadows where butterflies play.

Crystal streams dance through moss-covered stones,
Reflecting skies where sunlight softly drones.
Tall trees stand guard, their branches entwined,
Secrets whispered, ancient and kind.

Crimson sunsets blaze across the land,
Stars ignite as twilight takes command.
Nature's lullaby, a soothing refrain,
Whispers peace upon life's gentle plain.
And in the stillness, a quiet grace descends,
A beauty that forever transcends.
