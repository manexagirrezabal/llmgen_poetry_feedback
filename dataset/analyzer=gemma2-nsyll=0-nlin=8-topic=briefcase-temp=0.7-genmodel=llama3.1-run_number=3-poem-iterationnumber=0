A symbol of power, a tool so fine,
The briefcase stands, a professional's sign.
With leather worn and gold in sight,
It carries dreams, through day and night.

Its contents hidden, yet oh so grand,
Secrets and deals, at its command.
From boardrooms to streets, it makes its way,
A trusted ally, in the business fray.
