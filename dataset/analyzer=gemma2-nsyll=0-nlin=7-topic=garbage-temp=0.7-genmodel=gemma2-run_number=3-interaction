 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Paper mountains, refuse wide.

A feast for flies, a lesson to learn.
We cast it off with careless hand,
A burden on this fragile land.
Will future eyes our waste behold?
