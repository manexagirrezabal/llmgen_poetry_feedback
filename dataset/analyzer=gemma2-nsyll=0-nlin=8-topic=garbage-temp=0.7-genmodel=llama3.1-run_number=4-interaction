 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic bags and discarded dreams,
Littered streets and future themes.

A symbol of our careless way.
We must take heed and make a change,
Before the garbage claims its range.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
