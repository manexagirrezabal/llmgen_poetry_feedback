A whispered word, a stolen glance so sweet,
A touch that sends a shiver down my spine.
Your laughter rings, a melody complete,
And in your eyes, a universe I find.

My heart beats fast, a rhythm wild and free,
When near you stand, a warmth I can't explain.
With every breath, I long to simply be
Lost in the love that whispers your name.

Through storms and sun, our bond will ever grow,
A tapestry of trust, forever strong.
Two souls entwined, where passions gently flow,
In this embrace, where we truly belong.

Love's gentle hand, guides us through life's embrace,
A timeless dance, with joy in every space.
