 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark presence softly slays
The light of life that once did shine
Fades to black, and is no longer mine

A whispered secret, known to few
The final breath, the last goodbye too
Ephemeral moments lost in time
As mortal hearts succumb to death's cold crime

 Memories linger, a bittersweet refrain
Echoes of joy, now tinged with pain
In darkness lies an endless sleep
Where love and laughter softly creep

And though it comes, as inevitable fate
Death's mystery remains, beyond our state
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that resonated with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
