 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase worn with weary face
Contains the weight of busy pace
Papers and pens, a cluttered space
A symbol of a life in a frantic chase

It's carried high, with shoulders bent
The daily grind, its constant bent
A refuge for the mind at night
A reminder of the endless fight
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
