A plastic tide, a papery wave,
Where cans and bottles in silence rave.
Food scraps decay, a pungent stew,
Forgotten treasures, lost to view.

The stench hangs heavy, a choking haze,
As nature weeps for forgotten days.
A symphony of rustling, crunching sound,
Where creatures scavenge on barren ground.

A silent plea from this dismal sight,
For change, for action, with all our might.
Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this wasteland into a vibrant state.
