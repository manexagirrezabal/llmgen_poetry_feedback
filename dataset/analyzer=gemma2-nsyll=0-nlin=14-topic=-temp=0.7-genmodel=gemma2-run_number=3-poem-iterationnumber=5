The sun descends, a fiery ball of gold,
Kissing the clouds with hues of red and pink.
A gentle breeze whispers tales untold,
As twilight's embrace begins to sink.

Stars ignite, like diamonds in the night,
Upon a canvas dark and deep and vast.
The moon ascends, a beacon shining bright,
Guiding lost souls as moments pass.

Shadows lengthen, stretching towards the ground,
And crickets chirp a lullaby so sweet.
A world at rest, where peace can be found,
As weary hearts find solace in retreat.


Night's gentle touch, a balm for aching eyes, 
Inviting dreams beneath starlit skies.
