Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
As stars above their vigil keep and fill

The night air whispers secrets to the trees
Their branches sway in gentle, soothing breeze
The wind it howls a lonely, mournful sigh
As darkness reigns, and light says goodbye

In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm that all my worries cease
The world may be loud, but here I am free
From noise and strife, in harmony

The night's dark veil, it gently wraps around
And in its silence, I am found.
