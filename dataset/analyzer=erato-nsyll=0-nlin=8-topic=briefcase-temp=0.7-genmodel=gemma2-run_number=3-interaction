 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
It holds secrets, hopes, and grasps
At dreams of deals and meetings grand,
A silent partner, close at hand.
Through bustling streets and crowded halls,
It journeys on, answering calls.
A symbol of ambition's might,
The briefcase carries on the fight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š
