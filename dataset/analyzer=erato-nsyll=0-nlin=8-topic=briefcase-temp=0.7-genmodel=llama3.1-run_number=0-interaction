 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, it stands tall and fine,
The briefcase holds secrets, both business and mine.
With leather exterior, and pockets so neat,
It carries my documents, where I take a seat.

In meetings and conferences, it's by my side,
A trusted companion, that never will divide.
But when the day is done, and it's time to go home,
The briefcase rests empty, with no work to roam.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
