 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic bottles, paper scraps,
A mountain growing on our maps.
Food waste, wrappers, broken toys,
Polluting earth with careless joys.

Landfills swell, oceans groan,
Our future's seeds we have overthrown.
Less is more, recycle and mend,
For a cleaner world, let's make amends. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
