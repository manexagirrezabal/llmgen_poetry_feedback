In alleys dark and streets so wide,
A trash-filled landscape meets our eye.
The stench of rot and decay does rise,
As garbage grows in endless surprise.

Plastic bags and bottles abound,
Forgotten treasures lost to the ground.
Food wrappers and papers fill the air,
A toxic cloud that's hard to bear.

In landfills deep, it's a dismal fate,
Where waste is buried, sealed and great.
But still we throw, without a care,
And let our messes pile up there.

The earth cries out for a cleaner way,
Reducing waste, starting today,
To live in harmony each new day
