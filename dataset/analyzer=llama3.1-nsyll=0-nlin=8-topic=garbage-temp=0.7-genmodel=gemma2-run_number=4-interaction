 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where once green leaves and flowers thrived.
Containers rust, their contents seep,
Into the soil where life did sleep.
A symphony of buzzing flies,
As nature weeps with mournful sighs.
We built our world on waste so vast,
And now its shadow holds us fast. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
