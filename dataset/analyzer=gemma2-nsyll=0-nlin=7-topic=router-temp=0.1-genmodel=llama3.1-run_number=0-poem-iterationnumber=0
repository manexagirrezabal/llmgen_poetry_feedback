In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
Through wires and airwaves, data does entwine
With each new device, its workload does grow
But still it hums on, a faithful servant to know
Keeping the network alive, as information flows
