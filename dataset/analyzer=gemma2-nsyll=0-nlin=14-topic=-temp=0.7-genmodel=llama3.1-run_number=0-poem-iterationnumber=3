Silent moonbeams dance upon my floor
A midnight glow that I adore
The stars above, a twinkling sea
Reflecting dreams that long to be free

In this still hour, I find my peace
A world outside, its worries release
The night air whispers secrets in my ear
Of distant lands and memories so dear

The shadows cast, a mystic spell
That weaves a tale of love that dwells
Within the heart, where true stories sleep
And legends born, their vigil keep

In this quiet hour, I find my way
Through labyrinths of life's endless day
