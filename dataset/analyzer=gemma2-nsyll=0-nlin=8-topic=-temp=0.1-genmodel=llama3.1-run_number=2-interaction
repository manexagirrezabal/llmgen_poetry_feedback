 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and magic fill each space

The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As darkness reigns, the night says goodbye
But in this hour of quiet rest
Lies a beauty that's forever best
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
