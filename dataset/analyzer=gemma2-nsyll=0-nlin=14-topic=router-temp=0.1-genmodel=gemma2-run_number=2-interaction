 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making data known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
A symphony of packets, swift and bright,
Guiding information through day and night.

No hero's cape, no fanfare or acclaim,
Yet vital threads it weaves within its frame.
The unseen force that keeps us all entwined,
A digital bridge for every heart and mind.

So raise a glass to this humble device,
The router's magic, ever in our vice. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
The router stands, its secrets it will keep.
It speaks in packets, data's fleeting flight,
Connecting worlds both day and darkest night.

From screens to phones, a web it does extend,
A silent guardian, till the very end.
No fanfare rings, no trumpets sound its praise,
Yet through its wires, knowledge finds its ways.

It bridges gaps, unites us far and wide,
A digital heart, where thoughts can freely ride.
So let us thank this humble, unseen friend,
Whose constant work, our lives does comprehend. 

A silent hero, in the modern age,
The router's power, on history's page.
