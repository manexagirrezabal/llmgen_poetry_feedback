Rays of sunshine filter through the trees,
A gentle breeze rustles the leaves with ease.
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
Inviting all to wander, wild and serene.

A brook babbles on, its melodic song,
As petals bloom, and colors dance along.
Nature's beauty, pure and strong and free,
A symphony of wonder, for you and me.
