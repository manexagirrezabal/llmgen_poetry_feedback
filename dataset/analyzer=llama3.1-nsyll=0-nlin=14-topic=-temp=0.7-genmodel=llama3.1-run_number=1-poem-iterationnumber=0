Silent stars shine in midnight sky
A celestial showcase, passing by
The world is hushed, a peaceful sight
As darkness reigns with gentle might

The moon's soft glow illuminates the night
A silver crescent, pure and bright
The wind whispers secrets, wild and free
In harmony with nature's symphony

The trees stand tall, their branches sway
Dancing to the rhythm of the day
Their leaves rustle softly, a soothing sound
As the world around them spins round and round

In this quiet moment, I am at peace
Connected to the universe's release.
