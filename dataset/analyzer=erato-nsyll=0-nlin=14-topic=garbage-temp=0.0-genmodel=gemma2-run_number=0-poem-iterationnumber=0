A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and wrappers, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature's light gives way.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid smell,
As creatures scurry through the broken glass.
A silent testament to stories fell,
Forgotten treasures, time cannot surpass.

We build our empires on this fragile ground,
And leave behind a legacy of pain.
Can we not learn, can we not turn around?
To mend the Earth, before it's all in vain?

Let us reclaim what we have cast away,
And build a future where trash finds its day.
