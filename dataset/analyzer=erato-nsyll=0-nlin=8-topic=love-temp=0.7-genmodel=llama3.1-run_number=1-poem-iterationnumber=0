Soft whispers in the dead of night
A gentle touch that sets the heart alight
Love's flame burns bright, a guiding light
That leads us through life's darkest plight

With every beat, our love does grow
In tender moments, our hearts bestow
A love so strong, it conquers fear
And fills our souls with joy and cheer
