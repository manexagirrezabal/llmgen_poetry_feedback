A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where bottles and cans eternally lie.
Food scraps decay, a pungent decree,
And paper whispers tales that slowly die.

The stench hangs heavy, a choking embrace,
As nature recoils from this human blight.
Forgotten treasures in this dismal place,
Lost to the darkness, swallowed by night.

A symphony of crunching, rustling sound,
Where creatures scavenge for scraps they can find.
A silent plea, on barren ground,
For change, for action, a mindful kind.

Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this wasteland into a vibrant state.
