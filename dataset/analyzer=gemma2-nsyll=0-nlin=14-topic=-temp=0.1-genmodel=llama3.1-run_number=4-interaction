 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The forest whispers secrets to the trees
As wind and water weave a gentle breeze

In this still hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm that the world can't release
The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, for all to know

The night air vibrates with magic spell
A time for dreams, when worries fade and fell
The darkness shines with an ethereal light
Guiding me through the endless, starry night

In this quiet hour, I find my way
Through the shadows, to a brighter day.
