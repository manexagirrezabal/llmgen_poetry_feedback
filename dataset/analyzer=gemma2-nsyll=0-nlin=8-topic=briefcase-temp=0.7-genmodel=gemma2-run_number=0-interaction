 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A humble shell, of leather brown,
With clasps that snap and lock it down.
Inside, a world of paper dreams,
Of deals and plans, and flowing streams
Of ink and thought, in neat array,
That hold the power to shape the day.
A briefcase's weight, a silent plea,
To build, create, and set things free. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
