The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustling, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where wildflowers grow.

A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
A mournful tune that echoes in the air.
Time slows its pace, a gentle retreat,
As autumn's breath brings beauty everywhere.

Crimson maples dance against the sky,
Their fiery branches reaching for the light.
The world transforms, a vibrant lullaby,
Before winter's slumber claims the fading night.

So let us pause and savor every hue,
This fleeting moment, precious and anew.
