 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's cold hand does creep
A silent thief, in endless sleep
It takes our breath, and steals our sight
Leaving behind, an empty night
The living mourn, with tears so true
Their loved ones gone, forever new
In eternal rest, they wait for you
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic, feel free to ask!
