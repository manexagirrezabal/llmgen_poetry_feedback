 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A final breath, a whispered sigh,
The curtain falls, the lights grow dim.
A silent sleep, beneath the sky,
Where shadows dance and spirits swim.
No pain remains, no fear to hold,
Just peace that wraps the weary soul.
A journey ends, a story told,
In whispers soft, beyond control. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
