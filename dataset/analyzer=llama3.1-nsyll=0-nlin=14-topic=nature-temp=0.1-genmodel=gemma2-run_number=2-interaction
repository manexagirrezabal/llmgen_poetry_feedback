 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap 'neath the willow's shade,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And nature's symphony is gently played.

The moon ascends, a pearl in velvet night,
Stars twinkle bright, like diamonds scattered wide,
A tapestry of wonder, pure and light,
Where peace descends, and weary souls can hide.

In nature's embrace, we find solace deep,
A sanctuary where our spirits sleep.

 > assistant: Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze caresses fields of gold,
Where wildflowers bloom, a vibrant scene,
And stories whispered by the wind unfold.

A babbling brook sings its tranquil tune,
As silver fish dart 'neath the willow's sway,
The air is sweet with summer's afternoon,
And birdsong fills the forest's gentle way.

Clouds drift like dreams across a canvas blue,
While butterflies on painted wings take flight,
Nature's beauty, forever fresh and new,
A symphony of colors, pure delight.

In this embrace, our worries fade away,
And peace descends upon a perfect day.
