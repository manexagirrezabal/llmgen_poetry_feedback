Trash cans overflow with discarded dreams
Plastic bags and bottles fill the streets it seems
A sea of waste that chokes the air we breathe
A constant reminder of our thoughtless leave

The earth cries out in pain and despair
As human greed and laziness are laid bare
We throw away without a care or thought
Leaving behind a legacy to be fraught
