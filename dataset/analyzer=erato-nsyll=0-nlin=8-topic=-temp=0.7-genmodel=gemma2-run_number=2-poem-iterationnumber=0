The wind whispers tales through leaves so green,
A symphony of rustling, soft and keen.
Sunlight dances, dappled on the ground,
Where shadows stretch and secrets can be found.
A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
While flowers bloom, their colors rich to greet
The gentle breeze that carries hopes aloft,
And paints the world in beauty, pure and soft.
