 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Where paper boats forever ride.
Glass shards gleam, a broken dream,
And food scraps rot, a putrid stream.
Forgotten toys and rusted cans,
A silent testament to human plans.
Garbage whispers, "What have we done?" 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing prompt! ✍️  </p>
