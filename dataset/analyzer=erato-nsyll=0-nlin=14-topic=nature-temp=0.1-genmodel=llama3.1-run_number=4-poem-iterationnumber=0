The forest whispers secrets deep,
Where ancient trees their vigil keep.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle breeze,
That stirs the wildflowers in ease.

A brook babbles on its winding way,
Through hills and valleys, night and day.
Its source unknown, yet flowing free,
A symbol of life's mystery.

The sun shines bright, with warm rays bold,
Bringing new life to the earth below cold.
The stars appear, like diamonds rare,
Twinkling in the evening air.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace,
And a sense of wonder that will never cease.
