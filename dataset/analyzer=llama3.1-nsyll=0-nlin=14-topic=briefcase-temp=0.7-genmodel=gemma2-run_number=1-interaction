 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sentinel of steel, it stands so tall,
With leather skin and clasps that hold it tight.
Within its depths, secrets rise and fall,
Dreams, ambitions, hidden from the light.

From boardroom meetings to coffee-stained cafes,
It traverses streets, a silent, steady guide.
Through bustling crowds, it carves its chosen ways,
A vessel for the thoughts that reside inside.

Its weight a burden, yet a badge of worth,
A symbol of ambition, hard work's due.
Each meeting won, each victory on Earth,
Is sealed within, a testament anew.

So let it stand, a fortress made of dreams,
The briefcase whispers, "Greatness still gleams." 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can write for you. ðŸ˜Š
