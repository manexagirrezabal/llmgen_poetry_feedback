The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap, chasing after light,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And stars begin to twinkle in the night.

The moon ascends, a pearl upon the sky,
Casting its glow on sleeping fields below,
Nature's embrace, a lullaby nearby,
Where peace and beauty gently ebb and flow.

A symphony of silence fills the air,
As darkness falls, and dreams begin to share.
