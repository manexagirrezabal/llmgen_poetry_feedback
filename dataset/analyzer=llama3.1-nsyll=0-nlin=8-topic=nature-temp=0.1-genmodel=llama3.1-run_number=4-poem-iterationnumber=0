The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Dancing in the breeze with gentle might.

The river flows with waters cold,
Reflecting beauty yet to be told.
The mountains rise with peaks so high,
A majestic sight that touches the sky.
