A briefcase, worn and weathered, brown and strong,
Holds secrets whispered, where futures belong.
Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Contracts signed, bathed in golden office light.

From bustling streets to boardrooms grand and tall,
It walks with purpose, answering ambition's call.
A silent witness to triumphs won and lost,
The briefcase carries burdens, at any cost.

Each click of latch, a promise softly made,
Of goals achieved, fortunes carefully laid.
A symbol of success, a tool refined,
It journeys onward, leaving none behind.
