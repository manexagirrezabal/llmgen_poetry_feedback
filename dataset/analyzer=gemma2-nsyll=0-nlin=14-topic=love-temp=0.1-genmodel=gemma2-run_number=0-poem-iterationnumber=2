A whispered word, a glance that speaks so true,
Two souls collide, a love forever new.
A gentle touch, a spark that sets aflame,
A symphony of hearts, a whispered name.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Their bond grows stronger, answering love's call.
In every sunrise, a promise to embrace,
A tapestry of moments, time cannot erase.

With open arms, they welcome every day,
Two souls entwined, forever come what may.
A love that blooms, a garden bright and fair,
Where dreams take flight, and burdens disappear.
