In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark specter holds its sway
A whispered promise of eternal rest
For souls weary from life's unrest

With gentle touch or ruthless grasp
It claims us all, in endless pass
No escape from its inexorable stride
Only a fleeting moment to abide

 Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading whispers of what lives cease
In darkness, we find our release
From pain and sorrow, and humanity's plea

Yet even death cannot erase
The ache of loss that time will not erase
