 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.

A mess that's made for me and you.
The earth cries out in dismay,
As waste accumulates each day.
A problem growing, come what may.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
