 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.
In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And with it, hope and joy abide.
Forever and always, love will reside.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you about love. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
