 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle touch ignites the flame,
Warming hearts and soothing every pain.
In eyes that meet, souls find their way,
Together entwined, come what may.

With whispers sweet, and tender sighs,
Love's beauty blooms, and never dies.
It's a feeling that time cannot fade,
A bond between two hearts, forever made.

Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
A constant love, that's always best.
In every moment, it shines so bright,
Guiding us forward, through day and night.

Love's pure and true, a precious find,
A treasure to hold, one of a kind.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about love for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
