A symbol of professionalism so fine,
The briefcase stands with dignity divine.
Leather bound and sturdy to the core,
It holds the secrets of its owner's score.

With latches that click and a handle so bright,
It's a trusted companion through morning light.
Inside it stores papers, contracts and more,
The weight of responsibility it does store.

Through meetings and deals, it's always by their side,
A constant presence as they take their stride.
It's a reflection of power, of status too,
A badge of honor for those who know what to do.

With every step, it swings with gentle ease
And accompanies its owner in busy days
