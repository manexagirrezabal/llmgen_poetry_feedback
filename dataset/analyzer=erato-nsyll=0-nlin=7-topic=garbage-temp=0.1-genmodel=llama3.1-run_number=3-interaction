 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A messy sight for me and you.
The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As waste accumulates, don't you know?
It's a problem that we must not show.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
