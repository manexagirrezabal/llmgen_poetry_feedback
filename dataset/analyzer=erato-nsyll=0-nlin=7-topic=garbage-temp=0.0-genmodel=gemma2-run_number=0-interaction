 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A silent story, slowly made.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A future choked, a world obscene.
Will we wake up, or will it be too late? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  ✨
