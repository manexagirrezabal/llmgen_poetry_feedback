A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, data flowing free.
Connecting worlds, both near and far, between,
A digital bridge, for you and me.

Packets dance upon its circuits bright,
Through channels swift, a constant stream they ride.
From distant shores to screens bathed in soft light,
The router guides them, with unwavering stride.

No hero's cape, no fanfare at its call,
It works in silence, answering every plea.
A humble servant, standing strong and tall,
Ensuring connection, eternally.

So raise a glass, to this unsung device,
That binds us closer, through the digital ice.
