A whispered word, a tender embrace,
Love's gentle touch, time cannot erase.
Two hearts entwined, a symphony of souls,
In love's sweet dance, our story unfolds.

Through fields of green and skies so blue,
Love's guiding light, forever true.
Hand in hand, we walk life's way,
Sharing laughter and dreams each day.

With every glance, a spark ignites,
A love that burns with endless lights.
No distance vast, no time can part,
This bond we share, a work of art. 
Two souls united, forever free.
