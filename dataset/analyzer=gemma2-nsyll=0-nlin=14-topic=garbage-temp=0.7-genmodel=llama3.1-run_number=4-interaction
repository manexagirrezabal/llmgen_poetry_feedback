 > assistant: In alleys dark, where shadows play
A mountain high of trash does sway
Plastic bags and bottles abound
A sea of waste that's all around

The wind it howls, a mournful sigh
As garbage swirls, and dust does fly
Forgotten cans and crumpled news
 Lie strewn about, in disarray's muse

The stench of rot, a noxious smell
Fills lungs with air, that's hard to tell
Is this the price, we pay for ease?
A world awry, where waste increases?

In this bleak scene, we find our fate
A future grim, an earthless state
 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.

The wind it howls, a mournful sigh

Lie strewn about, in disarray's muse

The stench of rot, a noxious smell
Fills lungs with air, that's hard to tell
Is this the price, we pay for ease?
A world awry, where waste increases?

We must change now, before it's late
And find a way, to clean up our state
 > human: Thank you!
