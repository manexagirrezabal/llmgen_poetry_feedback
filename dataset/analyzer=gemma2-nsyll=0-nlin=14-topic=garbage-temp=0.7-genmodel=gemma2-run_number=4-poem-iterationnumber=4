A sea of plastic, bottles tossed and turned,
Where crumpled cans their silent stories learned.
Forgotten dreams, in paper wrappers burned,
A monument to waste, our hearts adjourned.

The stench of rot, a symphony of grime,
Where nature's balance struggles for its time.
Landfills rise, consuming space sublime,
A heavy burden on this earthly climb.

But even here, a stubborn flower thrives,
Amidst the refuse, where life survives.
A fragile hope, dispelling all our strives,
To mend our ways, and keep our planet alive.
