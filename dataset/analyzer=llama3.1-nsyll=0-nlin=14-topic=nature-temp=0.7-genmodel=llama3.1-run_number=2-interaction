 > assistant: The forest stands, a towering wall
Of green and brown, a silent call
To those who wander through its shade
A place of peace, where worries fade

The trees above, a canopy so grand
Shielding all from sun's hot hand
Their leaves rustle soft, a soothing sound
As nature's music echoes all around

A brook babbles by, its gentle flow
Reflecting sky and forest below
The scent of blooms, a sweet perfume
Fills the air, a fragrant room

In this wild place, I find my rest
And let the beauty of nature be my guest.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad you enjoyed the poem. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
