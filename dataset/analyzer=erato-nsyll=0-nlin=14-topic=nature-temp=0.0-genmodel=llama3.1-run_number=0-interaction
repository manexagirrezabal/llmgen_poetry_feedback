 > assistant: The forest whispers secrets deep,
Where ancient trees their vigil keep.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle hush,
As sunbeams filter through the rush.

A brook babbles on its winding way,
Through hills and valleys, night and day.
Its source unknown, yet flowing free,
A symbol of life's mystery.

The mountains stand, a towering wall,
Their peaks aflame with morning's call.
The wind whispers secrets in their ear,
As clouds drift by, without a fear.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace,
And solace from the world's wild release.
