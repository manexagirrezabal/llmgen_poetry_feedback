 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting us all.
Through wires and waves, it sends data's flight,
A web of information, day and night.
From distant servers to screens in our hand,
It bridges the gap, a digital strand.
Invisible guardian, keeping us near,
The router whispers, "Let knowledge appear." 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
