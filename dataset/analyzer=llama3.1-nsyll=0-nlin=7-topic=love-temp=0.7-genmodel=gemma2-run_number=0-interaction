 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a touch so light,
Love's flame ignites in darkest night.
Two souls entwined, a sacred dance,
A symphony of joy and chance.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's gentle bond embraces all.
Forever bound, a timeless vow. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
