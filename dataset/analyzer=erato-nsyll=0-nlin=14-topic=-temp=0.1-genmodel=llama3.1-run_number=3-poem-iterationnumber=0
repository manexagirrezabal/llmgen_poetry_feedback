Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams, a moment to fulfill

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours flow
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall
And in the distance, a lonely bell does call

In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm, that the world can't release
My heart beats slow, my soul takes flight
As I let go, and surrender to the night

The darkness reigns, but it's not cold or grey
For in its depths, I've found a peaceful way
