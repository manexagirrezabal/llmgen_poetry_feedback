A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
Connecting worlds where data streams take flight.
Invisible threads, secrets it does keep,
Guiding packets through the digital night.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a web of knowledge, vast and wide.
No hero's mantle, yet its power keen,
To bridge the gaps, on which our lives reside.

A silent guardian, ever watchful, true,
Ensuring every message finds its way.
A humble servant, steadfast, tried, and new,
The router's pulse keeps modern life at bay.

So let us thank this box, unseen, unheard,
For all the connections it has stirred.
