In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across distant lands
It navigates the web, with precision fine
Routing packets swiftly, in digital time

In homes and offices, it's a constant guest
A behind-the-scenes hero, we don't repress
It keeps our networks humming, day and night
A steadfast companion, in the digital light

With Wi-Fi waves, it dances through the air
Connecting us all, without a single care
