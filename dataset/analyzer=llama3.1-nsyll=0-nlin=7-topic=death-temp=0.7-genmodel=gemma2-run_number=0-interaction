 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a gentle sigh,
The final breath, a starlit sky.
A life unfolds, then gently fades,
To silent sleep, where memory pervades.
No more the pain, no more the fear,
Just peace profound, forever near.
A soul departs, on wings unseen. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. 😊  Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ✍️
