The final curtain falls, the stage grows dim,
A silent hush descends, where shadows swim.
No more the vibrant hues of life's display,
Just fading echoes whispering away.

But memories linger, like embers in the night,
Reflecting moments bathed in warm sunlight.
Though tears may fall and grief may cloud our sight,
Love's gentle touch brings solace and its light.

For death is not an ending, but a sleep,
A journey to a realm where secrets keep.
And though we mourn the loss of those we knew,
Their spirits dance in skies forever blue.
