In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and discarded things,
A messy sight that brings us kings.

Of pollution's heavy, crushing weight,
The earth cries out in a desperate state.
We must reduce, reuse, and recycle too,
For the future's sake, our actions shine through.
