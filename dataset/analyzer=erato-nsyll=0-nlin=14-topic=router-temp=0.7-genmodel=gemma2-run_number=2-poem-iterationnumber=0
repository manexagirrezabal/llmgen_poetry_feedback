A silent guardian, unseen, unheard,
The router stands, a web of data blurred.
Through copper wires and wireless light it weaves,
Connecting worlds, fulfilling digital needs.

From distant screens to files shared with ease,
It bridges gaps, a constant, steady breeze.
With packets sent and received in swift array,
Information flows, illuminating the day.

A hub of traffic, humming soft and low,
Ensuring networks seamlessly grow.
But hidden deep within its plastic shell,
A symphony of signals, stories to tell.

So raise a glass to this unsung machine,
The router's magic, forever evergreen.
