 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent stars shine in midnight sky
A lonely moon glows with gentle sigh
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep
As darkness reigns, and all is deep
The wind whispers secrets, soft and low
In this still hour, my heart does flow
With peaceful thoughts, my soul takes flight
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you'd like another one or need any changes, feel free to ask!
