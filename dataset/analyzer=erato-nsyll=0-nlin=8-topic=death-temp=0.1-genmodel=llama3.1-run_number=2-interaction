 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's cold hand does creep
A silent thief, in endless sleep
It takes our breath, and steals away
Leaving memories to fade with day

The living mourn, with tears and sighs
As loved ones pass, and say goodbye
Their legacy remains, a bittersweet refrain
Echoing through life's fleeting pain
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
