The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, extinguished in our hearts.
No more the touch, the laughter, or the smile,
Just empty space where life once walked a while.

A tapestry unwoven, threads now frayed,
A silent song, forever unafraid.
But memories bloom like flowers in the sun,
Their fragrance lingers, though the journey's done.

The soul takes flight on wings unseen and free,
To realms of peace, where shadows cannot be.
And though we mourn, and tears may freely fall,
Love's gentle hand will guide us through it all.

For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms beyond our earthly shore.
