 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain, drawn at last,
The final act, a fading cast.
No more the sun's warm, golden ray,
No laughter echoes through the day.
A whispered sigh, a gentle breeze,
Through branches bare, among the leaves.
The world moves on, a steady pace,
While shadows dance in death's embrace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š
