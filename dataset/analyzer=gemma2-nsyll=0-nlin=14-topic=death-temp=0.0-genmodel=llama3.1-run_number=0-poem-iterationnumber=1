In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, its story told
Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's breeze

In darkness reigns, the silent king
Where light and love, their vigil sing
Yet even death, cannot erase
The memories of life's fleeting pace

For in the end, it's not what's lost
But what remains, that death has crossed
