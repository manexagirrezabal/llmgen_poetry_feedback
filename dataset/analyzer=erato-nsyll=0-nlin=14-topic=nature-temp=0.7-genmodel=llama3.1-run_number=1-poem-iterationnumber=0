In twilight woods, where shadows play,
The trees stand tall, in gentle sway.
Their leaves rustle soft, with summer breeze,
As sunbeams filter through the trees.

A brook babbles on, its crystal song,
Echoing through the forest long.
Wildflowers bloom, in vibrant hue,
Dancing in wind, both old and new.

The mountains rise, in rugged might,
Their peaks reaching for the morning light.
A flock of birds, in chorus sing,
As nature's beauty starts to spring.

In this wild scene, I find my peace,
A sense of calm, my soul's release.
