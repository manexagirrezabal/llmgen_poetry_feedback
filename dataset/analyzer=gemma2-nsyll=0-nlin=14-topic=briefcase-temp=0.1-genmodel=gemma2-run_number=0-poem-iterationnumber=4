A briefcase, more than just a simple shell,
Holds dreams and schemes, ambitions swell.
Within its depths, a world takes flight,
Of deals struck fast, both day and night.

From boardroom walls to bustling city streets,
It carries burdens, hopes, and weary feats.
The click of latches, a steady beat,
As plans are made, and futures meet.

A silent witness to triumphs won,
And losses felt beneath the setting sun.
So raise a glass to this trusty guide,
That walks beside us, side by side.
