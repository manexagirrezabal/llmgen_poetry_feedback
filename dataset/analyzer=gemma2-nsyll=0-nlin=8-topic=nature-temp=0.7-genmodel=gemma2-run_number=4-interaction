 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Emerald leaves in sunlight dance,
A gentle breeze, a soft romance.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Whispering secrets to morning dews.
Birdsong fills the air with cheer,
As nature's symphony rings clear.
From towering trees to babbling stream,
A tranquil haven, a waking dream. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  🌻  Let me know if you have any other requests. 😊
