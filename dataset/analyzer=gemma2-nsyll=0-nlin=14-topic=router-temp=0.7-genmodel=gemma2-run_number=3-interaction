 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of plastic, humming low and deep,
It sits unseen, a silent sentinel.
Connecting worlds with data's steady sweep,
A digital bridge where stories dwell.

From distant shores to screens within our hand,
It weaves a web, invisible and vast.
A constant flow, across the promised land,
Of bytes and bits, forever moving fast.

No grand facade, no shining metal sheen,
Just circuits humming, electrons in their race.
Yet through its heart, a vibrant world is seen,
Where voices chat, and laughter fills the space.

So thank the router, humble as it seems,
For bringing us together, in our digital dreams. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š Let me know if there's anything else I can write for you.
