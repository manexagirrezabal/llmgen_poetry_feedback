 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wild and carefree.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks touched by the golden light.
The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
In nature's beauty, my soul finds sleep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that resonated with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
