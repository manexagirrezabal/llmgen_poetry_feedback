Sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,
Whispering secrets to the breeze.
A robin's song, a melody sweet,
Fills the air with joy complete.

Butterflies flutter, wings so bright,
Sipping nectar in the golden light.
Flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's canvas, ever new.

Crystal streams meander through the green,
Reflecting skies, serene and clean.
The scent of pine, a calming grace,
Embracing earth in time and space.

A symphony of life unfolds,
Nature's beauty, stories untold.
