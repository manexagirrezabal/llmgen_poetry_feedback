 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds, a digital dream.
Packets dance through wires, swift and bright,
Guiding data through day and night.
From distant servers to your screen's embrace,
It weaves a web of information's grace.
The router hums, a tireless guide,
Unlocking knowledge, side by side. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!
