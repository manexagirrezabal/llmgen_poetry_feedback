A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase stands, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Carrying secrets, and business claims

Inside its depths, papers are stored
 Contracts signed, and deals explored
The weight of responsibility it bears
As professionals navigate through the years

From boardrooms to meetings, it's by their side
A trusted companion, never to divide
Its contents a mystery, yet to be told
A briefcase's story, one that's yet untold

In the hands of the owner, it finds its place
A reflection of character, in every single case
