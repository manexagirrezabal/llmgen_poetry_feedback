The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds with hues of pink and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to the sky,
As twilight's embrace begins to unfold.

Stars begin to shimmer, one by one,
Diamonds scattered on a canvas dark and deep.
The moon ascends, its silver journey begun,
Guiding lost souls as they softly sleep.

Shadows lengthen, stretching long and thin,
And crickets chirp a lullaby so sweet.
A world at rest, where worries fade within,
As peaceful slumber brings a welcome retreat.

Night's gentle touch, a balm for weary eyes,
A promise whispered of dreams beneath the skies.
