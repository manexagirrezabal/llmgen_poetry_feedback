A spark ignites, a flame takes flight,
Two hearts entwined in love's soft light.
A whispered word, a gentle touch,
Emotions bloom, loved oh so much.

Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's constant presence conquers all.
A bond unbreakable, strong and deep,
In love's sweet haven, secrets we keep.

With every glance, a story told,
Two souls united, hearts unfold.
Forever bound, in love's embrace,
A timeless journey, heart to face.
