A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes where life once infused.

A stillness settles, heavy on the air,
As memories dance and gently disappear.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers travel, seeking solace blessed.

But in the silence, something softly sings,
A melody of love that ever clings.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That opens to a realm we can't explore.

And though the body fades, the spirit flies,
To realms unknown beneath eternal skies.
