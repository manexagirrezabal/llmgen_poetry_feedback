 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams, a moment to fulfill

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours go slow
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall
As night's sweet peace, begins to enthrall

In this calm hour, the heart can roam
Free from the din, of the world's loud home
Where worries fade, and love shines bright
And in the darkness, a gentle light

A time for reflection, a moment to share
The beauty of the night, beyond compare
