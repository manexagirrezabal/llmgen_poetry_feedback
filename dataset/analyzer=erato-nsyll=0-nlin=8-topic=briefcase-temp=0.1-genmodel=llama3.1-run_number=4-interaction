 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase lies on the floor so fine,
Its leather worn from years of use divine.
It holds the tools of a busy day's grind,
And keeps them safe with its sturdy mind.

The papers inside are neatly stacked high,
The pens and pencils ready to catch the eye.
A symbol of work, it stands tall and proud,
A trusted companion for those who wear it loud.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
