 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Data streams flow through its intricate core,
Bridging distances, opening distant doors.
From emails sent to games played with glee,
The router hums, a symphony you see.
Invisible force, keeping us online. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
