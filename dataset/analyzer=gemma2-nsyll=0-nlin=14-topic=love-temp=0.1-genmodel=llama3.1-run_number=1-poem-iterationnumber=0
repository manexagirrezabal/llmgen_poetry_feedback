Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
It's a bond between two souls so true,
A connection that forever shines through.

With every kiss, with every tender care,
Love grows stronger, and our hearts are aware.
Of the beauty that it brings to our lives,
A sense of belonging, a love that thrives.

In love's sweet arms, we find our peaceful nest,
Where our hearts beat as one, and love is at its best.
