Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As night's dark veil begins to rise
In this still hour, I find my peace
And let the world's wild beauty release
