 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making data known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
A symphony of packets, swift and bright,
Guiding information through day and night.

No hero's cape, no fanfare or acclaim,
Yet vital threads it weaves within its frame.
The unseen force that keeps us all entwined,
A modern marvel, one of a kind.
So raise a glass to this humble device,
That grants us access, knowledge, and advice. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
