The sun dips low, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds in hues of red and pink.
A gentle breeze whispers tales untold,
As day surrenders to the twilight's brink.

The world grows quiet, shadows start to creep,
Across the fields where golden wheat once swayed.
Stars begin to glimmer, secrets deep,
In velvet skies where dreams are gently laid.

An owl's soft hoot breaks the evening calm,
A symphony of crickets fills the air.
Night descends, a soothing, gentle balm,
And weary souls find solace and repair.

The moon ascends, a silver orb so bright,
Guiding us through darkness into light.
