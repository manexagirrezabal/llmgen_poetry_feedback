 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As life's last breath slips into the sky

The heart that beats, now still and cold
 Memories of love, forever to hold
In darkness lies, a peaceful rest
Eternal sleep, for the soul's unrest
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
