 > assistant: The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
Upon the hills, a golden bliss.
Shadows stretch, like fingers long,
And crickets chirp their evening song.
Stars begin to softly gleam,
A silent world, a tranquil dream.
Night descends, a velvet shroud. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  âœ¨
