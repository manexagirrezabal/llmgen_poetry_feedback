 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now rot sets free.
Tin cans clanging, paper's brittle sigh,
Ghosts of meals past, beneath a leaden sky.
Forgotten treasures, cast aside with haste,
A testament to waste, an endless taste
Of careless habits, a world undone,
Until we learn, the Earth is not our one. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked it. 😊 🌎  Is there anything else I can help you with?
