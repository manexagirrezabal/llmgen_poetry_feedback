 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets as the breeze pursues,
And wildflowers dance in sunlight's golden snare.

A babbling brook sings softly through the trees,
Reflecting azure skies and mirrored grace,
While butterflies on painted wings appease,
Their thirst for nectar in a sunlit space.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Invites the soul to wander, free and light,
Where nature's beauty knows no end,
And worries fade into the fading night.

A tapestry of wonder, rich and deep,
Nature's embrace, where dreams and secrets sleep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can create for you.
