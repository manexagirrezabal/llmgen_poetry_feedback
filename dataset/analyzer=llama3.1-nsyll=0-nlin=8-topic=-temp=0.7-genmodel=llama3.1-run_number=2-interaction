 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlit waves crash on the shore,
A soothing melody evermore.
The stars up high, a twinkling show,
A celestial display to know.

The night air whispers through the trees,
As shadows dance with gentle ease.
The world is hushed in quiet sleep,
Underneath the moon's soft creep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome, enjoy the poem!
