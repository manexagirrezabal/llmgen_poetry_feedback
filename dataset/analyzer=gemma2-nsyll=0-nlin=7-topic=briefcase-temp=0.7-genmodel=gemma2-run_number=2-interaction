 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, with clasps so tight,
Holding secrets, day and night.
Dreams and schemes, contracts untold,
Whispers shared, in stories bold.
The weight of worlds, upon its frame,
A symbol etched, within its name.
The briefcase waits, for destiny's call. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative writing requests. ðŸ˜Š
