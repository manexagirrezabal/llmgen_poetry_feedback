A leather shell, worn smooth by time's embrace,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams within its hold.
The briefcase stands, a silent, steady face,
Through boardroom battles, stories yet untold.

It carries weight of deadlines, hopes, and fears,
A constant companion on the daily grind.
From coffee shops to meetings, through the years,
Its clasps secure ambitions we find.

A symbol of success, a tool for trade,
A journey's map, with every page unfurled.
The briefcase waits, its purpose unafraid,
To carry burdens, conquer this world.

So open wide, and let your story start,
With every step you take, a brand new work of art.
