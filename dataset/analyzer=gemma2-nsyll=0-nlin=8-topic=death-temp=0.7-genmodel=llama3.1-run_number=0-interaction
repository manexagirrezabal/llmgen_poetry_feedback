 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silence, darkness gathers near
A whispered farewell, a final tear
The last breath taken, the heart does cease
A life extinguished, in eternal peace

 Memories linger, of joy and strife
A legacy remains, beyond all life
Death's mysterious veil, we cannot see
Eternity awaits, for you and me
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
