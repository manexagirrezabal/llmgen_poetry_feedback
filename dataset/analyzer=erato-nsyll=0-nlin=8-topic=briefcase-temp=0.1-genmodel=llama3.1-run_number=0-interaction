 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents for all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the contents, side by side.

Inside its depths, a world is stored,
Papers and files, carefully explored.
The weight of responsibility it bears,
A trusted companion through busy days and cares.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
