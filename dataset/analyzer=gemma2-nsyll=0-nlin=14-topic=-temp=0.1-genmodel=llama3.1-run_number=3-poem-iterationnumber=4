Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams, a time to fulfill

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours go slow
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall
And rustles leaves that fall, with a gentle call

In this peaceful hour, I find my rest
My heart and soul, in harmony blessed
The world may be loud, but in this night's keep
I find my solace, my heart's sweet sleep

The darkness shines, with a gentle light
Filling my spirit, with pure delight
