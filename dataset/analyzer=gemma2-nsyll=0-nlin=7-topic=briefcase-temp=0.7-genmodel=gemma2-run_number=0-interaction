 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
Holding secrets, up and down.
Meetings, deals, and whispered plans,
Within its clasp, life's shifting sands.
From boardroom walls to city streets,
It follows dreams and fleeting feats.
A silent witness, ever near. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if I can create anything else for you. ðŸ˜Š
