In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes our breath, and claims the land

With whispered secrets, he leads us away
From life's warm light, into endless gray
Our hearts still beat, in final sighs
As death's dark veil, closes weary eyes
