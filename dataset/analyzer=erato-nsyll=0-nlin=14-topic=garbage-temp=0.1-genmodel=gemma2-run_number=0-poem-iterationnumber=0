A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, a symphony
Of clinking cans in the sun's harsh ray.

The stench of rot, a bitter perfume,
As nature weeps for what we cast aside.
A silent scream, a mournful gloom,
In this wasteland where beauty once resided.

We build our empires on fleeting desires,
And leave behind a legacy of waste.
Will future generations bear the fires
Of our indifference, their spirits erased?

Let us mend our ways, reclaim the earth,
Before its final, silent, tragic rebirth.
