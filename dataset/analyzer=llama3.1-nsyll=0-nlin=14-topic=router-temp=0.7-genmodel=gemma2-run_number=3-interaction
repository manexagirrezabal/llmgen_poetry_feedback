 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It weaves connections, vast and wide,
Through ethernet cables, data does ride.

From modem's pulse to screens aglow,
The router hums, a steady flow.
Packets dance, across the airwaves bright,
Connecting worlds, day and through night.

A gateway to knowledge, a social sphere,
It grants us access, banishing fear.
But fragile it is, a network's heart,
One flicker, one crash, can tear worlds apart.

So let us praise this humble device,
That brings us closer, with digital spice. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
