In darkened halls of silence deep,
Death's shadow falls, its presence keep.
A whispered name, a final sigh,
The heartbeat slows, and then goodbye.

The mortal coil is laid to rest,
The body still, in eternal nest.
The soul departs, on unknown tide,
Leaving behind, a hollowed pride.

Memories linger, of life's bright flame,
Fading embers, that once bore its name.
In darkness, death's cold hand is found,
A mysterious force, that turns it down.

Yet, even in death, there's peaceful rest,
And our spirits find their eternal nest,
With final silence, all is at end.
