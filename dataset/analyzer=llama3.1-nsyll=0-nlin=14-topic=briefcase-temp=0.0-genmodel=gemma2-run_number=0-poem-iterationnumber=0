A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans we hope to find.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that can be bought,
And futures built on choices we embrace.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks beside us, a familiar friend.
A symbol of success, or bitter defeats,
Its contents shift, our journeys never end.

So raise a glass to this unassuming case,
A vessel for the stories time will trace.
