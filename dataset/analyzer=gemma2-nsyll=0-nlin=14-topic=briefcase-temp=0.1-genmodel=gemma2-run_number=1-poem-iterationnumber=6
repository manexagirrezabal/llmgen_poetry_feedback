A briefcase, more than leather and brass,
Holds hopes and fears, ambitions amassed.
It travels city streets, a steady beat,
Through boardrooms grand and coffee shop heat.

Inside its depths, contracts take their form,
And whispered deals weather every storm.
A silent witness to triumphs and strife,
It carries burdens through the course of life.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality's sound,
As day surrenders to night profound.
A symbol of progress, a tool refined,
The briefcase waits for futures yet to find.
