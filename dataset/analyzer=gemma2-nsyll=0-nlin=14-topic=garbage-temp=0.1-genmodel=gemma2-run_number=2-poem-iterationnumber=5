A plastic tide, a metal sea of waste,
Where dreams are buried, hopes decay and fade.
Forgotten wrappers, carelessly displaced,
Whispering tales of yesterday's parade.

Glass shards glitter, sharp and cold as ice,
Paper ghosts dance in the wind's embrace.
Metal cans, their stories sacrificed,
Lost in this refuse-filled, desolate space.

A landfill's heart, a festering, poisoned ground,
Where nature weeps and creatures flee in fear.
Let us mend our ways, with purpose profound,
To heal this earth, make it clean and clear. 
This blight we've wrought, must end right here.
