 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets that are busy all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery hidden, yet to unfold

In meetings it's opened with care
Papers and files, a story to share
The weight of responsibility it bears
A trusted companion, through joys and snares

It's closed at night, its work done for the day
Its secrets kept safe, until another way
 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
