 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A final breath, a whispered sigh,
The curtain falls, the lights go dry.
No more the laughter, no more the tears,
Just silence deep, throughout the years.
A body still, a soul released,
To realms unknown, where shadows feast.
A journey ends, a chapter closed,
In death's embrace, our story imposed. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š   Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
