 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it sits so fine,
A router's heart, with wires entwined.
It guides the data, with speed and might,
Through cyberspace, day and endless night.

With IP addresses, it keeps track of all,
Routing tables, to ensure no fall.
It's the unsung hero, behind the scene,
Keeping connections, smooth and clean.

In homes and offices, it's a common sight,
A small device, with a big impact bright.
It connects us all, in this digital age,
To the world outside, through its virtual stage.

With Wi-Fi signals, it reaches far and wide,
A router's role, is to keep data inside.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
