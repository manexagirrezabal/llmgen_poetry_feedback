A box of wires, humming low,
Connecting worlds, to and fro.
Packets race, a digital stream,
Through circuits spun, a waking dream.

From distant shores to screens so near,
It shares our thoughts, banishes fear.
A silent guide, unseen, unknown,
The router weaves connections sown.

In every click, in every scroll,
Its magic touch makes stories whole.
A modern marvel, small and bright,
It keeps us linked, both day and night.
