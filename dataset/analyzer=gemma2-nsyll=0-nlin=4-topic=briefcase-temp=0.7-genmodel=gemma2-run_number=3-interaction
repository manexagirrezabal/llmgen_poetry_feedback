 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets, dreams, and tasks to grasp.
Through bustling streets it strides with grace,
A silent witness to life's race. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š  

Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?  âœ¨
