The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the touch, the voice, the loving gaze,
Just empty space where laughter used to blaze.

A silent tear falls on a withered rose,
As memory's garden gently overflows.
But in the stillness, whispers softly rise,
Of moments shared beneath celestial skies.

The soul takes flight, on wings unseen and free,
To realms unknown, beyond mortality.
And though the body sleeps in slumber deep,
Love's echo lingers, secrets it will keep.

So let us grieve, yet find solace in the light,
That death is but a passage to the night.
