 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines with 8 syllables each about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.

A veil descends, and shadows fly.
The body sleeps, its journey done,
A soul departs to realms unknown.  



 > human: The number of syllables in the fourth line is 9 and it should have been 8. Can you create a poem with the right number of syllables? Return only the poem, nothing else.
