 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather-bound box, worn with pride

Confidential files, safely locked asleep
In the briefcase's depths, stories are concealed
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
