 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambition's weighty crown.
Within its depths, dreams take flight,
Deals forged in morning's silver light.
From boardroom walls to crowded streets,
Its presence whispers, "Fortune meets."
A silent partner, ever near,
The briefcase carries hope and fear.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! 

I'm glad you liked the poem. Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
