 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moonbeams dance on silver streams,
A symphony of whispers in the breeze.
Stars ignite, celestial dreams,
And fireflies paint the twilight trees.

A gentle hush descends the night,
As shadows stretch and secrets hide.
The world sleeps sound, bathed in soft light,
Until the dawn with colors ride. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  âœ¨
