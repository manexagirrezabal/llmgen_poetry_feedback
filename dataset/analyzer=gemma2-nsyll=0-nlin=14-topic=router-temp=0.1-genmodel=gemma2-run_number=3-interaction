 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It hums and glows, a beacon in the night,
Connecting worlds with data's swift flight.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a path, a virtual scene.
Emails fly, and games come alive,
Through its unseen channels, knowledge thrives.

A gateway to the vast and boundless web,
Where stories flow and secrets are kept.
It guards your privacy, a watchful eye,
Ensuring safety as you browse and try.

So thank the router, humble and discreet,
For bridging gaps and making life complete. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
