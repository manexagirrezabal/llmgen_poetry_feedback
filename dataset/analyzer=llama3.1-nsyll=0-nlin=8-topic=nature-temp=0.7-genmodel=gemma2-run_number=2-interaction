 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Green leaves unfurl in morning light,
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Birdsong fills the air so bright,
And wildflowers dance upon the breeze.
Sunlight streams on meadows green,
A babbling brook flows clear and free,
Nature's beauty, a vibrant scene,
A symphony for all to see. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊 🌿☀️  Let me know if you have any other requests! 🌻
