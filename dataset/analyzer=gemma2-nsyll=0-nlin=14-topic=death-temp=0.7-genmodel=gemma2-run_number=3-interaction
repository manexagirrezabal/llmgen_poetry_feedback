 > assistant: A whisper soft, a breath that fades away,
The final curtain falls on life's bright stage.
A silent hush descends, where shadows play,
And memories linger, turning every page.

No more the pulse that quickened in the breast,
No more the laughter echoing through halls.
Only a stillness, a profound unrest,
As darkness claims the body, breaks its walls.

But is this ending, or just a start?
A journey taken to a distant shore?
Where souls reunite, and spirits impart
Their wisdom gained, forevermore.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
In death's embrace, perhaps we find our gain.

A silent touch, extinguishing the light.
No warning given, no farewells said,

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
Its vibrant pulse now stilled, its journey blessed.
But memories linger, whispers on the breeze,
Of laughter shared and moments meant to please.

Though tears may fall, and grief may hold us fast,
A gentle peace descends, shadows cast.
For in that sleep, a soul finds sweet release,
And journeys onward to a boundless peace.

Yet life's imprint etched upon the heart,
A tapestry of moments, set apart.

Love's gentle touch leaves comfort in its trace.
For death is but a doorway, leading on,
To realms unknown, where spirits journey on.
