 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a gentle sigh,
The curtain falls, the stars reply.
A final breath, a fading light,
From day to darkness, endless night.
No more the touch, no more the sound,
In silent sleep, on hallowed ground.
Eternity's embrace profound. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other requests. ğŸ˜Š
