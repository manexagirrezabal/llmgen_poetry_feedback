In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across distant lands
It navigates the web, with precision fine
Routing packets swiftly, in digital time

A guardian of networks, it stands tall and strong
Protecting from threats, where cyber dangers belong
With firmware updates, it stays ahead of the pack
Ever vigilant, its duty to track

In the background, it works tirelessly night and day
Keeping connections open, come what may
