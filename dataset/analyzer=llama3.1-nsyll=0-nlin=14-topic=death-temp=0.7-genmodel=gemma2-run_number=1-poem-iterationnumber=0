The veil of night descends, a silent shroud,
Where shadows dance and whispers softly speak.
A final breath escapes, a whispered vow,
As life's bright tapestry begins to leak.

No longer bound by flesh and mortal pain,
The soul takes flight on wings unseen, unknown.
To realms beyond the reach of sun and rain,
Where seeds of memory are gently sown.

Though grief may linger, heavy in the heart,
Let love's embrace bring solace and release.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A journey to a realm of endless peace.

So sleep now soundly, free from earthly strife,
And dream your dreams beneath the stars aloft.
