 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of wires, hums unseen,
Connecting worlds, both small and green.
Packets dance, a digital stream,
Across its core, a silent gleam.
From web to game, it makes them flow,
A silent shepherd, to and fro.
The router's heart, where signals grow. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š
