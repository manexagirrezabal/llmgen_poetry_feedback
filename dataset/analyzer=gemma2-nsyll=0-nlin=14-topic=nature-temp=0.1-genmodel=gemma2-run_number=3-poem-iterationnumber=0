The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
As gentle breezes whisper through the trees,
And rustling leaves dance in a silent prayer.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
Reflecting sunlight on its crystal flow,
While wildflowers bloom, a vibrant, colorful treat,
Their petals open, kissed by morning's glow.

The scent of pine and earth fills every breath,
A tapestry of green, a calming sight,
Where peace resides, and worries find their death,
In nature's embrace, both warm and bright.

So let us wander, lost in this serene,
And find solace where our spirits intervene.
