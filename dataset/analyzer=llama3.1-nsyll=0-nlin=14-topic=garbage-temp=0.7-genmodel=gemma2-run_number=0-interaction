 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where wrappers dance and bottles sing their plea.
Forgotten scraps, a feast for hungry flies,
And broken dreams in cardboard's hollow sighs.

The stench ascends, a miasma thick and gray,
While nature weeps for what has gone astray.
A landfill's heart, a silent, festering tomb,
Where once-loved things meet their forgotten doom.

Oh, heed the warning, whispered on the breeze,
Before our planet crumbles to its knees.
Reduce, reuse, recycle – let it be known,
This burden shared, a future we can own.
A cleaner world, a hope that brightly gleams,
If only we will mend these broken streams. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  😊
