 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten meals, a broken toy,
Lost dreams discarded, cast as void.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A silent plea, a mournful scene.
Will we learn to mend what's torn apart? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
