 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic bags and paper plates,
A symphony of discarded fates.
Tin cans clanging, bottles bright,
A landfill's growing, endless might.
We fill it up with careless ease,
Forgotten dreams and fleeting pleas.
The earth groans under weight so vast,
A future clouded, shadows cast.
But hope remains, a flickering spark,
To mend our ways, to leave our mark.
Recycle, reuse, let's turn the tide,
Respect the planet, side by side.
Reduce the burden, make it less,
For Earth's embrace, we must confess. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. 😊  Is there anything else I can help you with?
