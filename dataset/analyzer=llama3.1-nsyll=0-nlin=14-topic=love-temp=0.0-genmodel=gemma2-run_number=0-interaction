 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to flow.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

No words can capture, the depth of their embrace,
A timeless journey, etched upon each face.
Love's melody, a symphony so sweet,
A tapestry woven, with love complete. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 12 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A silent spark that ignites like summer bloom.
Two souls collide, a symphony unheard,
A melody of longing, every beat and word.

A touch so light, it sends a shiver down,
A blush that spreads, a secret smile is found.
In stolen moments, hearts begin to race,
A yearning deep, a love they can't erase.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Their bond grows stronger, answering love's call.
Two destinies entwined, a path they choose,
To walk together, bathed in love's sweet hues.
