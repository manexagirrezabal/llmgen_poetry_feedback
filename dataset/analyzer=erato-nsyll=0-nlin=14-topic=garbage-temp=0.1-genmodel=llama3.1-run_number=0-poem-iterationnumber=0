In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A mess that's made, for me and you.

The smell is strong, a putrid stench,
That clings to all, with no pretense.
Food waste rots, a feast for few,
While humans pass, with nothing to do.

The earth cries out, in sorrow deep,
As pollution spreads, its dark creep.
We throw away, without a care,
Leaving behind, a toxic snare.

But still we hope, for a cleaner day,
When garbage's gone, and all is okay.
