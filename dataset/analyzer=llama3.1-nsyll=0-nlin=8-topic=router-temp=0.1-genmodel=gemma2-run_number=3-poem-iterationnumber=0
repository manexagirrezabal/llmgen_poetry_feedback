A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam.

It guides the flow, a traffic master bold,
Ensuring whispers travel, stories told.
Through networks vast, connections unfold,
The router hums, its magic takes hold.
