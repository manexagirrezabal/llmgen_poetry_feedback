The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
As autumn paints the world in hues untold.
Crimson and amber, a fiery display,
Where summer's warmth gently fades away.

A chill in the air, a crisp morning breeze,
Nature slumbers, beneath the rustling trees.
Soon winter's touch will blanket the land,
But beauty lingers, in nature's grand hand.
