The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, stories untold.
Sunlight paints shadows, long and serene,
As nature's canvas transforms, a vibrant scene.
Crimson and amber dance in the breeze,
Autumn's embrace, a bittersweet ease.
Days grow shorter, nights begin to creep,
While slumbering earth prepares for winter's sleep.
