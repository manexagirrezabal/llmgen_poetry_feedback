Your eyes, twin galaxies, ablaze with light,
Reflecting back my love, both pure and bright.
A smile that blooms, a sunrise in my soul,
Melting away the shadows, making me whole.

With every touch, a spark ignites anew,
A symphony of feelings, strong and true.
Your voice, a whisper, soft upon the breeze,
Carries secrets only hearts can seize.

We dance through life, hand clasped within mine own,
Two souls entwined, our destinies unknown.
But one thing's certain, as time marches on,
Our love will conquer, ever strong and long.
