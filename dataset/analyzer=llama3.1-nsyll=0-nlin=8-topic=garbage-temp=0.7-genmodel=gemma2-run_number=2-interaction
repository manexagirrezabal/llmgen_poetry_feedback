 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic mountain, towering high,
Of bottles, cans, and wrappers fly.
The paper piles, a crumpled heap,
Where dreams of recycling softly sleep.
Food scraps decay, a pungent scent,
A symphony of waste, misspent.
Oh, garbage, burden on our land,
A silent plea for helping hand. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
