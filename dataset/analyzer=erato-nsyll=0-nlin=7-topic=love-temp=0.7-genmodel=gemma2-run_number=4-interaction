 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
Laughter echoes, tears they share,
Through sunshine bright and stormy air.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
Love's gentle touch, forever new.
In every glance, a whispered vow. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! 😊  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing prompt.  I'm always happy to help! ✍️✨
