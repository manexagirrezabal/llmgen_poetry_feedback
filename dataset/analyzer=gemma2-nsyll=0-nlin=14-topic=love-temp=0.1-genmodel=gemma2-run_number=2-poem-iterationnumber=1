A whispered word, a stolen glance,
A heart that beats, a joyful dance.
Two souls ignite, a flame so bright,
Guiding through darkness, into light.

With every touch, a spark ignites,
A symphony of love, taking flight.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Their bond unbreakable, standing tall.

In whispered secrets, dreams unfold,
A story written, never to grow old.
Forever bound, in time's embrace,
Love's gentle rhythm, sets the pace.

Two hearts entwined, a love so true.
