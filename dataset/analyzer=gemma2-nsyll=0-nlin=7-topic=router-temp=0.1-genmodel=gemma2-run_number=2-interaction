 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Packets dance, a digital ballet,
Through wires spun, it guides them on their way.
From distant screens to servers far away,
The router hums, its duty to convey.
A bridge of bits, where worlds converge and play. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️✨
