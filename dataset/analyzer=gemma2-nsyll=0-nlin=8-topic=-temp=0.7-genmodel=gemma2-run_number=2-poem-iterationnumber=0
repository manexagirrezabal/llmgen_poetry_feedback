The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of autumn, stories untold.
Crimson and amber dance in the gentle breeze,
As nature's canvas paints with vibrant ease.
Sunbeams filter, casting shadows long,
Where squirrels gather nuts, their winter song.
Days grow shorter, nights begin to creep,
And slumber whispers, lulling all to sleep.
