A final breath escapes on silent wings,
Life's vibrant song now softly sings its end.
No more the laughter, tears that once did flow,
Just empty echoes where the heart used to glow.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A tapestry of moments, now grown cold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits glide?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light. 
Where shadows lengthen and the sun descends,
The soul embarks on journeys without ends.
