 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In streets and alleys, trash does pile
A burden weighed upon the earth's soil
Plastic bags and bottles, discarded with ease
Leaving behind a toxic, festering disease

The once-green parks now littered with decay
A grim reminder of our throwaway way
The landfills grow, a monument to our waste
As nature struggles to cope with humanity's haste

The air is thick with fumes from rotting food
And the stench of mold that clings like a hood
The earth cries out for mercy and a cleaner hand
But still we pour more garbage into this barren land

Will we learn to live in harmony with earth?
Or will our waste continue to leave its mark?
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create the poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
