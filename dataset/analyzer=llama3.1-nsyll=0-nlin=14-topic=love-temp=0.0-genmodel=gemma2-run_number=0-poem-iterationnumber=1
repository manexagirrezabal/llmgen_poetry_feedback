A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A silent spark that ignites like summer bloom.
Two souls collide, a symphony unheard,
A melody of longing, every beat and word.

A touch so light, it sends a shiver down,
A blush that spreads, a secret smile is found.
In stolen moments, hearts begin to race,
A yearning deep, a love they can't erase.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Their bond grows stronger, answering love's call.
Two destinies entwined, a path they choose,
To walk together, bathed in love's sweet hues.
