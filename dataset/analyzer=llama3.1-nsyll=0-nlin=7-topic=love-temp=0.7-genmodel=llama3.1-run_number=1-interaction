 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.
In its warmth, we find our peaceful place,
Where fears and doubts are washed away by love's embrace,
And in each other's eyes, our hearts entwine.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
