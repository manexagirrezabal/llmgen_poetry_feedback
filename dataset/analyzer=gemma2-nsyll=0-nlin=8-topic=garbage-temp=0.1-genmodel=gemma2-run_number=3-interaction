 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A silent story, slowly made.
The earth groans under weight of waste,
A future choked, a bitter taste.
Let's mend the rift, reclaim the ground,
And turn this sorrow upside down. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
