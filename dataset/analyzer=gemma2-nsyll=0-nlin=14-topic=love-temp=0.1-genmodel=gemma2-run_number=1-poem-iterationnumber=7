A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A spark ignites, dispelling all the gloom.
Two souls connect, a symphony unheard,
A silent language, every beat and word.

Laughter dances, light upon their face,
A gentle touch, a warmth in time and space.
Their hands entwined, a promise to hold fast,
Through life's adventures, shadows overcome at last.

With every sunrise, love begins anew,
A tapestry of dreams, forever strong and true.
Two hearts as one, a bond that cannot break,
In love's embrace, their spirits gently wake.
And in this dance, they find their perfect place.
