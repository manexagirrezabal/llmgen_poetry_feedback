 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Through thick and thin, they stand up tall.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
Love's melody, forever heard.
A bond unbreakable, pure and true. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
