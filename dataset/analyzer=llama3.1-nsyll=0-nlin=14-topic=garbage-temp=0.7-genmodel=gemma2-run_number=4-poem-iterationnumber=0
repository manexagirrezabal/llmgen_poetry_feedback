A mountain of refuse, cast aside,
Plastic and paper, metal intertwined.
Forgotten remnants, once held high,
Now festering waste, beneath the sky.

Bottles and cans, a jumbled array,
Food scraps and cartons, where dreams decay.
Tires and toys, lost in disarray,
A silent chorus, whispering dismay.

The stench of rot, a heavy shroud,
On nature's beauty, a grim cloud.
Will we ever learn, to turn it around?
To mend our ways, on solid ground.
Or let this burden, forever confound?
