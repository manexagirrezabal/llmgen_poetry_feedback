The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, stories untold.
Sunlight paints shadows, long and serene,
As autumn's embrace turns the world evergreen.

Crimson and amber, a vibrant display,
Nature's masterpiece, fading with each day.
Squirrels gather treasures, winter's approach,
While geese fly southward, on wings that encroach.

A chill in the air, a hint of frost's kiss,
The season transforms, in a gentle abyss.
Memories linger, of summer's warm grace,
As autumn descends, with its melancholic embrace.

And leaves fall softly, like whispers of time,
A bittersweet beauty, both fragile and sublime.
