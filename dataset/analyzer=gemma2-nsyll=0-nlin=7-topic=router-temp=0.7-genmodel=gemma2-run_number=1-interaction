 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it sits and waits,
A network's heart, sealing digital fates.
Packets flow through its intricate design,
Connecting worlds, a web both yours and mine.
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam,
The router hums, a whispered cyber dream.
A bridge of bits, where information streams. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I'm glad you liked the poem. If you have any other creative requests, feel free to ask! ğŸ˜Š
