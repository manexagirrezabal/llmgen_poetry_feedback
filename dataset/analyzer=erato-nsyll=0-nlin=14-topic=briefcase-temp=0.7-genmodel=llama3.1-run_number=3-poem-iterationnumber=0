A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase lies open, ready for sight
 Documents and papers, carefully arranged with care
Files and folders, each one labeled to share

Its leather exterior, smooth to the touch
Inviting those who glance upon it to clutch
 Inside its depths, secrets are kept from prying eyes
And deals are made, in hushed tones, as business guys rise

In boardrooms and offices, it's a common sight
A trusted companion, through morning light
It holds the keys, to success and fame
As professionals navigate, with briefcase in hand they claim

Their place at the top, where power and wealth reside
The briefcase is more than just a bag to abide
