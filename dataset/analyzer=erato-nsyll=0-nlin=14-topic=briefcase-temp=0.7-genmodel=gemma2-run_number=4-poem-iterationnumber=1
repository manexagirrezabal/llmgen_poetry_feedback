A polished shell of leather, sleek and strong,
It holds the weight of futures, right or wrong.
Within its depths, a world of deals untold,
And stories whispered, secrets to behold.

From morning rush to evening's fading light,
It carries burdens, day and through the night.
A silent witness to ambition's climb,
Where victories are won and hearts entwine.

Across the city streets it makes its way,
A symbol of success, come what may.
With every step, a promise on the line,
A testament to dreams, both grand design.

It stands for power, for the will to strive,
The briefcase waits, where fortunes come alive.
