A briefcase sits upon my floor
Filled with papers and documents galore
Its leather worn, its seams now tight
A symbol of work, day and night

It holds my secrets, my plans, my fears
The weight of responsibility through the years
I carry it with me, wherever I roam
A constant companion, a part of my home
