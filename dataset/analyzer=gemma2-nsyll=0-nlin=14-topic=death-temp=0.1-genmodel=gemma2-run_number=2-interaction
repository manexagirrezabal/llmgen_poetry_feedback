 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more applause, no laughter fills the air,
Just stillness deep, a weight beyond compare.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories linger, like embers in the night,
Warm glimmers dancing, casting gentle light.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's echo whispers, easing every strain.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms unknown, forevermore.

And though we grieve, and miss the ones we knew,
Their spirit lives within us, strong and true.

Though tears may fall, and grief may hold us tight,
Love's gentle embers burn with warming might.

For death is not an ending, but a change,
A passage to a realm beyond our range.
Where souls find solace, free from earthly pain,
And reunite in love's eternal reign.

As life's bright flame flickers and fades away.
The final breath escapes on silent wings,

Like stars that shimmer in the darkest night.
A gentle warmth remains, a love untold,
That binds our hearts, though stories now grow cold.

Though tears may fall and sorrow fills the air,
Hope's tender light shines ever bright and fair.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
