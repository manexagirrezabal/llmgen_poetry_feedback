 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves so bright,
Dancing in the breeze with gentle might.
The river flows, its waters cold,
Reflecting all that's been left to unfold.
Nature's beauty is a wondrous sight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you want another one or need anything else, feel free to ask!
