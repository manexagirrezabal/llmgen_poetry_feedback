The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
And birdsong fades as twilight softly brews,
A symphony of nature, seldom seen.

Tall trees stand guard, their branches reaching high,
To touch the stars that begin to appear,
While fireflies dance, a twinkling lullaby,
Dispelling shadows, banishing all fear.

The moon ascends, a silver orb so bright,
Casting its glow on meadows bathed in dew,
A silent world, embraced by gentle night,
Where dreams take flight and spirits renew.

Nature's embrace, a solace for the soul,
A timeless beauty that makes us whole.
