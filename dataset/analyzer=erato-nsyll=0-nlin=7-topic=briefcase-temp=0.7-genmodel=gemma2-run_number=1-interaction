 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Within it hides ambition's grasp.
From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
It holds the weight of dreams and feats.
Deals sealed within its sturdy frame,
Success whispered in each name,
A briefcase marches on with time. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
