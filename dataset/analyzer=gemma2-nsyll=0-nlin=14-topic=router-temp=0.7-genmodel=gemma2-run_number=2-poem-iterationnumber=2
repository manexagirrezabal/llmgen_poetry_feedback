A box of circuits, humming soft and low,
It weaves a web where data comes and goes.
Packets race through wires, swift and unseen,
Connecting worlds, both distant and between.

From screens to phones, it grants us access wide,
A silent guardian, ever by our side.
Through ether waves, it sends a whispered call,
To voices distant, standing strong and tall.

The router stands, a sentinel of light,
Guiding information through the digital night. 
No longer bound by distance, we can roam,
Thanks to its hum, bringing us back home.
