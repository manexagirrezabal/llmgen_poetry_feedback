A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting one and all.
Through wires thin or waves that fly unseen,
It weaves a web where data flows between.
From distant lands to screens within our grasp,
It bridges gaps, a digital clasp.
A modern marvel, humble in its might,
Guiding bits and bytes through day and night.
