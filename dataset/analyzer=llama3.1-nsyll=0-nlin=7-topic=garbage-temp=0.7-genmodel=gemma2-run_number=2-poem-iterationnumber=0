A mountain of refuse, piled high and wide,
Plastic and paper, where dreams once reside.
Cans and bottles, a jumbled array,
Leftover lives that have met their decay.
The stench hangs heavy, a somber refrain,
Whispers of wastefulness, etched in its stain.
We are the makers, the takers, the throwers away.
