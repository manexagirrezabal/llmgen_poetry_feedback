The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustling, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where the wildflowers grow.

A gentle stream meanders through the green,
Reflecting clouds that drift across the blue.
A robin sings a melody serene,
As nature's beauty dawns anew.

The world awakens with a vibrant sigh,
And every heart beats in time with its embrace.
Hope dances high against the morning sky,
Leaving behind the shadows of time and space. 


Let joy unfurl like petals in the sun,
A new day born, where dreams have just begun.
