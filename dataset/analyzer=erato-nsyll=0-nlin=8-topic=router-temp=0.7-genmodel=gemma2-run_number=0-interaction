 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent box, with blinking light,
Connecting worlds both day and night.
Through cables thin, and wireless streams,
It weaves a web of digital dreams.
From distant shores to screens nearby,
It shares the news, it lets us fly.
A humble servant, ever true,
The router guides, connects, and through. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
