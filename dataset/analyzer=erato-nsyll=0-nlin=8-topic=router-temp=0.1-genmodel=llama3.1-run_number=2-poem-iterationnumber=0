In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
Keeping our devices linked, in perfect design

With Wi-Fi waves dancing, through air so free
It bridges the gap, between you and me
A silent guardian, of digital streams
Keeping us connected, in a world of dreams
