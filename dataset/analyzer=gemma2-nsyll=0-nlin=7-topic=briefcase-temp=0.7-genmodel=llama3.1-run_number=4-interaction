 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy briefcase by my side,
Carrying papers with importance inside.
Labeled and organized, a sight to see,
Business meetings await, for you and me.
The handle worn, from hands that have passed,
Its contents secure, in a leather-clad fast,
A trusted companion, through the workday's pace.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
