Your touch, a whisper, soft upon my skin,
Ignites a spark, where love begins within.
Your smile, a sunrise, chasing night's dark veil,
Revealing beauty that will never fail.

With every word, my heart beats fast and free,
Lost in the magic you bring to me.
We dance as one, beneath a starlit sky,
Two souls connected, soaring ever high.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand we'll roam,
Finding solace in our love, our destined home.
A bond unbreakable, forever strong and true,
My love for you will always shine anew.
