 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death comes to claim the final day
A whispered breeze that stirs the air
And brings an end to life's sweet care

With gentle hand or sudden might
It takes its due in endless night
No sorrow loud, no joyous sound
As life departs without a bound

The heart beats slow, the pulse grows cold
The eyes grow dim, the spirit old
In death's dark realm, we find our fate
A silence deep, an endless wait

And though we mourn, we must not grieve
For in death lies a peaceful leave
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem that explores the theme of death. If you have any other requests or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
