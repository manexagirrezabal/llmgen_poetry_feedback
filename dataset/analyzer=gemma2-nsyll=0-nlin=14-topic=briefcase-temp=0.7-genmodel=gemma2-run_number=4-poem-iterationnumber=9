A sentinel of leather, sleek and bold,
The briefcase whispers tales yet to unfold.
Inside its depths, ambition takes its flight,
Dreams woven tight, both dark and shining bright.

From bustling streets to hushed boardroom halls,
It carries burdens, answering duty's calls.
Contracts signed in haste, decisions made,
Triumphs and failures, fortunes to be weighed.

A silent witness to the human race,
Its metal clasps hold time within their space.
A symbol etched in strength, both bold and true,
The briefcase journeys with us, me and you.
