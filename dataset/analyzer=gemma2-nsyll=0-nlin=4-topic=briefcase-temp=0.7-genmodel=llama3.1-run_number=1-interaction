 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, sleek and so fine,

Its contents hidden, but its importance is best.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help with the poem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
