In alleys dark, where shadows play
A mountain high of trash does sway
Plastic bags and bottles abound
A sea of waste that's all around

The wind it howls, a mournful sigh
As garbage swirls, and dust does fly
Forgotten cans and crumpled news
Lie strewn about, in disarray's muse

The stench of rot, a noxious smell
Fills lungs with air, that's hard to tell
Is this the price, we pay for ease?
A world awry, where waste increases?

We must change now, before it's late
And find a way, to clean up our state
