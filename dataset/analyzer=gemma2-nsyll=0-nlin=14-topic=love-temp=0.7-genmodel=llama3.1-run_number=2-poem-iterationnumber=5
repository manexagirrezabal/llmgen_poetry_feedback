Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
A feeling pure, a feeling true,
A bond between two souls, forever new.

In whispers soft, in kisses sweet,
It finds its voice, a love to greet.
With every touch, with every sigh,
It grows and deepens, reaching for the sky.

Through laughter and through tears, it stands,
A constant presence, hand in hand.
For love is kind, love is strong,
A guiding light that shines so long.
In love's sweet arms, we find our peace,
And a sense of joy that will forever release.
