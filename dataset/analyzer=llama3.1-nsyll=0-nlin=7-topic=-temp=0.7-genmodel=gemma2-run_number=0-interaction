 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The moon, a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Hangs heavy, casting shadows long and deep.
A whisper sighs through leaves, a rustling verse,
As fireflies ignite their secrets, sleep
And wake to dance among the velvet green.
A lone owl calls, a haunting, mournful plea,
And silence falls, a blanket soft and clean. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
