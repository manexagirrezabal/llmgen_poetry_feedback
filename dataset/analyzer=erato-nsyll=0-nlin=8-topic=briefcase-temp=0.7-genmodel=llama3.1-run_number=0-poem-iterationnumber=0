A symbol of power, it stands tall and fine,
The briefcase holds secrets, both business and mine.
With leather exterior, and pockets so neat,
It carries my documents, where I take a seat.

In meetings and conferences, it's by my side,
A trusted companion, that never will divide.
But when the day is done, and it's time to go home,
The briefcase rests empty, with no work to roam.
