 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,
Whispering secrets to the breeze.
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
As wildflowers bloom with vibrant flair.
Crystal streams meander through the wood,
Reflecting skies of azure good.
Nature's canvas, painted bright and bold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.  âœ¨
