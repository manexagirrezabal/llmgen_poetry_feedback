 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness falls the silent guest,
A presence felt, yet unseen at best.
It claims the living with gentle hand,
And takes them home to a distant land.

Their memories linger, a bittersweet refrain,
Echoes of joy and love in vain.
The final breath is breathed, the heart does cease,
And death's dark shadow finds its peaceful release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests (e.g. theme, style, tone), feel free to let me know!
