A swirling mass of plastic, paper, glass,
A testament to waste and hurried pace.
Forgotten meals, discarded dreams amass,
In heaps that grow with every passing trace.

The stench of rot, a symphony of grime,
Where nature's balance teeters on the brink.
A landfill's heart, a monument to time,
Where beauty fades, and hope begins to sink.

Yet even here, a fragile life may bloom,
Amidst the refuse, finding fertile ground.
A phoenix rising from the waste-strewn gloom,
A lesson whispered, turning grief around.

For in this chaos, we can choose anew,
To mend our ways, and build a world that's true.
