 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shades,
Misty mountains majestically parade,
Golden sunsets glow with peaceful hue,
Forest creatures whisper secrets anew,
The wind whispers through leaves so free,
Nature's beauty is a sight to see,
A world of wonder waits for you.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something nice for you. If you want another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
