Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze whispers a tranquil scene.
Wildflowers bloom in hues so bright and bold,
Butterflies dance, stories yet untold.

Crystal streams meander, sparkling clear,
Reflecting skies where clouds drift near.
Ancient trees stand tall, their branches sway,
Whispering secrets from a bygone day.

Crimson sunsets paint the western sky,
As stars ignite, twinkling on high.
Nature's symphony, a wondrous sight,
A tapestry of beauty, day and night.
