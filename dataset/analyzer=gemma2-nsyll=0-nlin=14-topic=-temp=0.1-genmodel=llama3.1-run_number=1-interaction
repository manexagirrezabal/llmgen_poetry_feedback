 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams to weave their mystic will

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours go slow
The wind whispers secrets through the trees so tall
And rustles leaves that whisper back to all

In this quiet hour, the heart can roam
Free from the noise of the world's loud home
Where worries fade and troubles cease to be
And in the stillness, peace comes to me

The night's dark veil, a shelter from the light
A time for rest, a refuge from the fight
