In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with calculated might
Through wires and air, it brings data to light
A humble hero, often unseen by sight
Yet without its aid, our online lives would take flight
In darkness and silence, the router holds tight
