 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten meals, a broken toy,
Lost dreams discarded, girl and boy.
The stench of rot, a buzzing sound,
Life's cast-offs on barren ground.
A silent plea, a whispered cry,
To mend our ways before we die. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
