Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
With every beat of our loving heart,
Love shines on, never to depart.
