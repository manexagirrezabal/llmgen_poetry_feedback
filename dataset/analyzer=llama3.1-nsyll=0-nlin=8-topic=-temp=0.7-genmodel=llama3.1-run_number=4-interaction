 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep,
Moonlight dancing on the water's sleep.
The night air whispers secrets to the trees,
As crickets serenade with gentle breeze.

The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still,
A midnight calm that soothes the troubled will.
The stars above twinkle like diamonds bright,
In the darkness shines a peaceful, endless light.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
