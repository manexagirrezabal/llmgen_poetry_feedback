Sunlight streams through leaves of vibrant green,
A gentle breeze whispers where wildflowers convene.
Crimson petals unfurl, a delicate sight,
Butterflies flutter in the warm, golden light.

Crystal clear streams meander through mossy ground,
Reflecting azure skies, peace profound.
Ancient trees stand tall, their branches entwined,
Guardians of secrets, for all time enshrined.

As twilight descends, the sun paints the west,
Crimson hues ablaze, a final behest.
Stars begin to glimmer, diamonds in the night,
Nature's lullaby whispers, soft and bright.
