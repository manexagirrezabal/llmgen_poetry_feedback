A briefcase, leather bound and worn,
Holds dreams and schemes since long ago born.
From bustling city streets to quiet lanes,
It carries burdens, eases life's strains.

Within its depths, a world takes flight,
Of contracts signed in day's bright light.
Ambitions whispered, hopes concealed,
Secrets shared, destinies revealed.

A symbol of power, or just a tool?
A faithful companion, playing life's duel.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so tall,
A constant presence, answering your call.
