The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
To painted clouds that blush across the sky.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
And shadows stretch, where day has once been seen.

Stars begin to shimmer, one by one,
Like diamonds scattered, when the night is spun.
A silver moon ascends her silent throne,
And owls awake, their haunting notes are known.

The world grows quiet, hushed in slumber deep,
As weary souls prepare for dreams to keep.
A peaceful stillness settles on the land,
A sacred space where worries can't withstand. 

In darkness born, a beauty we embrace,
A symphony of night, time and space.
