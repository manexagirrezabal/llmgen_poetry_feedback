The moon ascends, a silver orb so bright,
Casting shadows long in the hush of night.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of gold,
As life's last chapter gently unfolds.

No more the warmth of touch, no voice to hear,
Just silent memories held ever dear.
But love endures, a flame that will not cease,
Guiding lost souls toward eternal peace.

Though tears may fall and sorrow fills the air,
Remember joy's sweet echo everywhere. 
For death is but a transition, a new start,
A journey homeward to a loving heart.
