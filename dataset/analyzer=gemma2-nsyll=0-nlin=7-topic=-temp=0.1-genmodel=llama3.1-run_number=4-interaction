 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent stars shine in the midnight sky
A lonely moon glows with a gentle sigh
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep
Dreams dance upon the silent deep
The wind whispers secrets, soft and low
In this still hour, my heart does glow
With peace that only darkness knows
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you'd like another one or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
