 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets that are busy all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery wrapped in a story to hold

In meetings it's opened with care
Revealing plans, and deals to share
The briefcase is more than just a case
It's a keeper of dreams, and a holder of pace

It's a trusted friend, through the workday grind
A loyal companion, always on your mind
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
