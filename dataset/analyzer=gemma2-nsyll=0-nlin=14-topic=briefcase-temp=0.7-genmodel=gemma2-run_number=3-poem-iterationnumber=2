A leather shield, against the world's harsh gaze,
It holds the weight of futures, hopes, and days.
With every click, a promise held inside,
Of deals to seal, and dreams to be defied.

From bustling streets to boardrooms cold and bright,
It strides with purpose, bathed in office light.
A silent partner, trusted, ever near,
Through triumphs won, and battles fought with fear.

But sometimes closed, it speaks a somber word,
Of paths untaken, dreams that were deferred.
A weathered witness to ambition's flight,
A briefcase strong, against the fading night.
