 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to flow.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through stormy seas and calmest summer breeze,
Together standing, finding perfect ease.

With every beat, my heart sings your sweet name,
An endless journey, fueled by love's bright flame.
Forever bound, our destinies aligned,
Two souls as one, a love we'll always find. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 12 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A silent spark that sets my heart aflame.
Your laughter echoes, chasing away gloom,
And in your eyes, I see a love untamed.

We walk hand-in-hand through fields of gold,
Sharing secrets whispered on the breeze.
Each moment precious, stories to be told,
Of dreams we weave beneath the ancient trees.

A tapestry of moments, woven tight,
With threads of joy and sorrow intertwined.
Your love, a beacon shining ever bright,
Guiding me through darkness, peace I find.

Forever bound, our souls will intertwine,
In this love story, forever yours and mine.
