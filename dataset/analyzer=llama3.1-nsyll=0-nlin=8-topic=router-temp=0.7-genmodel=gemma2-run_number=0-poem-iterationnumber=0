A silent sentinel, it stands so small,
Yet weaves a web that conquers one and all.
Through cables spun and wireless waves unseen,
It guides our data, keeping us serene.
From distant servers to our screens alight,
The router toils through day and darkest night.
A modern marvel, often taken for granted,
But without its magic, worlds would be uncharted.
