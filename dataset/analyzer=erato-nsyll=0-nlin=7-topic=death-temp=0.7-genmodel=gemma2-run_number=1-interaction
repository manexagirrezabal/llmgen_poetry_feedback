 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent veil, a final sleep,
Where shadows dance and secrets keep.
The breath that once did rise and fall,
Now stills within an empty hall.
A whispered name, a tear that falls,
Life's tapestry, now frayed and small,
But memory blooms, beyond the wall. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
