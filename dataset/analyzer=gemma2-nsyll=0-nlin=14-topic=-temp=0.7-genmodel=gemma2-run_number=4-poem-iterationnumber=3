The sun dips low, a fiery ball of gold,
Kissing the hills with hues of red and brown.
A lonely hawk circles, stories to be told,
As twilight paints the world in shades profound.

The wind sighs softly through the rustling trees,
Their leaves like whispers, dancing in the breeze.
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
And shadows lengthen, stretching everywhere.

Stars begin to twinkle, one by one,
While silver moonlight bathes the land below.
The world is hushed, its day's work nearly done,
As peaceful slumber softly starts to grow.

And in this quietude, a sense of peace,
Finds solace in the twilight's gentle release.
