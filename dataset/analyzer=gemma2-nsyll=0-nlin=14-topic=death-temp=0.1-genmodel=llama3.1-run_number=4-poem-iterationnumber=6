In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beats, now still and cold
The soul that lived, its story told
Memories linger, like autumn leaves
Fading fast, as winter's breeze

In darkness reigns, the silent king
Where light and love, their vigil bring
Yet even death, cannot erase
The love we shared, in life's brief space

And though it comes, with final might
It brings release from endless night
