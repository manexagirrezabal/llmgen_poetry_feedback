A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and secrets kept,
In whispered words, emotions swept.

A gentle touch, a knowing glance,
A silent promise, a loving dance.
Through storms they weather, side by side,
Their bond unbreakable, their love a guide.

With every sunrise, hearts anew,
A tapestry woven, strong and true.
Forever bound, in time's embrace,
Love's gentle rhythm, sets the pace.

Two souls as one, forever free.
