In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
Connecting devices, in a digital line

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its might
Reaching far and wide, through day and night
A steadfast companion, for our online quest
Keeping us connected, and always at best
