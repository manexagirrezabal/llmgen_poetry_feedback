 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek briefcase on my shoulder lies
Carrying secrets and business ties
Its leather worn with each passing day
A symbol of power in a busy way
It holds my papers, notes, and files too
A trusted companion through meetings anew
My daily ally, both strong and true
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
