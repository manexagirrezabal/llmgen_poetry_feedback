 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek design, a sturdy frame
The briefcase holds its precious claim
Documents and papers, safely stored within
A professional's secrets, locked from sin

Its leather exterior, worn with pride
A symbol of success, side by side
With each step forward, it stays at hand
A trusted companion, in this busy land
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
