In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms so fine
Receiving and sending, in perfect time
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, to the digital thread

With Wi-Fi waves, it casts its gentle might
 Illuminating spaces, day and night
A steadfast guardian, of our online quest
Protecting us from harm, and doing its best

In the background, it works tirelessly on
Keeping our connections strong, until dawn
