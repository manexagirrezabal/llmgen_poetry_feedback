The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets as the breeze imbues
Them with a gentle dance, beyond compare.

A silver stream meanders through the wood,
Reflecting sunlight, dappled and serene,
While wildflowers bloom, misunderstood,
Their vibrant colors, a breathtaking scene.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Invites the soul to wander, free and light,
Where ancient trees their silent stories send,
And stars ignite the canvas of the night.

In nature's embrace, we find our peace,
A sanctuary where worries gently cease.
