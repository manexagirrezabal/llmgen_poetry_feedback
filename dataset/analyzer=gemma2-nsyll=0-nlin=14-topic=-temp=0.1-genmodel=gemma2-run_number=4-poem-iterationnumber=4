A lone wolf howls, a mournful, lonely sound,
Echoing through valleys, where shadows abound.
The moon, a pale disc, hangs in the velvet sky,
Casting silver fingers on branches passing by.

A chill wind whispers, rustling through the trees,
Carrying scents of pine and autumn's gentle breeze.
Stars like diamonds shimmer, scattered far and wide,
Guiding lost souls through the darkness they confide.

Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
As nature slumbers, secrets it will keep.
The world holds its breath, in this tranquil hour,
A moment of peace, with ethereal power.
