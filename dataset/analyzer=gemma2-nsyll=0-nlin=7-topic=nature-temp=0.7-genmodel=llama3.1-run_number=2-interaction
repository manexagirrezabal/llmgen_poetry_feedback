 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Mountain peaks touch the sky so high,
Rivers flow with gentle, soothing sigh.
Trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A forest's heartbeat, wild and carefree.
The sun shines bright, its warm rays abide,
In fields of green, wildflowers bloom with pride.
Nature's beauty, a treasure to behold inside.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
