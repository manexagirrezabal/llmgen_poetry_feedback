The sun dips low, a fiery ball of red,
Painting the clouds with hues that softly spread.
Long shadows stretch, as day begins to fade,
And twilight whispers secrets, gently made.

A lone bird sings, its melody so sweet,
As crickets chirp, a rhythmic, gentle beat.
The air grows cool, a stillness fills the night,
Stars begin to twinkle, diamonds shining bright.

A silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Casting its glow on fields that softly sigh.
The world is hushed, in slumber deep and sound,
Peace descends upon all, on hallowed ground.

And as we close our eyes, and drift away,
We dream of dawn, and a brand new day.
