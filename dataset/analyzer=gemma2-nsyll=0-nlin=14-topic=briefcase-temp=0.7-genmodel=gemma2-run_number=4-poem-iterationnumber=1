A leather shield, a sturdy frame,
Holds dreams and fears within its name.
It walks with purpose, sleek and bold,
Through city streets, stories untold.

Inside it sleeps ambition's spark,
Contracts signed in shadows dark.
Deals forged in whispers, plans unfold,
Success or failure, bought and sold.

A silent witness to the chase,
The briefcase carries time and space.
A symbol etched in metal bright,
Of power sought with all its might.
