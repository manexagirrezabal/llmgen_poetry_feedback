A leather case, so sleek and fine,
Holds papers, pens, and documents divine.
It's carried by the businessman with care,
Through meetings and deals, it's always there.

Its metal clasps shine like polished gold,
As it swings from his arm, a story to be told.
Inside its depths, secrets are kept tight,
A symbol of power, in morning light.
