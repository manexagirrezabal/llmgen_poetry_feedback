A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Bottles and boxes, a tangled mess,
A testament to our excess, I confess.
The earth groans under this weighty load,
A silent plea, a desperate code.
Let's mend our ways, reduce and reuse,
For a cleaner future, let's choose to choose.
