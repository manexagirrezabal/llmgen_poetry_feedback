The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting mountains in a peaceful sleep.
The stars appear, like diamonds in the night,
A celestial show, a wondrous sight.
