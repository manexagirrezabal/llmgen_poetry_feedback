 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten meals, a broken toy,
Lost dreams discarded, cast to destroy.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A silent plea, a mournful scene.
Will we learn to mend what we break? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
