 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell, of leather brown,
Holds secrets close, within its crown.
Papers stacked, and dreams aligned,
A future sketched, for heart and mind.
Across the floor, it strides with grace,
A silent witness to time and place.
The weight it bears, a heavy load,
Of hopes and fears, upon the road. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
