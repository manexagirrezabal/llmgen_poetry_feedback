 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness claims its own,
A final rest from life's loud tone.
Eternal sleep, a peaceful shore,
Where worries fade and love is more.

A fleeting thought that reaches the heart.
In stillness, death's presence is found.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
