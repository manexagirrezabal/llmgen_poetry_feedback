In alleys dark and streets so wide,
A mountain high of trash resides.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away with reckless flow.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A never-ending pile that's hard to pack.

The stench of rot and mold fills air,
As nature's beauty is beyond repair.
We reap what we sow, a lesson true,
In the garbage heap, our future shines through.

Let us reduce, reuse, and recycle with care,
And make a change before it's too late to share.
