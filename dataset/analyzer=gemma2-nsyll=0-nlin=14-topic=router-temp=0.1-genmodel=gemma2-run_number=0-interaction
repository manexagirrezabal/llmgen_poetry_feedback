 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It hums and glows, a beacon in the night,
Connecting worlds with data's swift flight.

From laptop screens to phones held tight,
It weaves a tapestry, both dark and bright.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
Where information flows, a constant tide.

But hidden depths within its shell reside,
Complex algorithms, where packets hide.
MAC addresses, IP's untold,
A language whispered, stories yet unfold.

So thank the router, humble and discreet,
For bridging gaps and making connections sweet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
