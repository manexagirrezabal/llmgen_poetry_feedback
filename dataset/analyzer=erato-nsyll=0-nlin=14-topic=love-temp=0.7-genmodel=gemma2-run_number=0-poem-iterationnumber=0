A spark ignited, a flame took flight,
Two souls entwined in love's gentle light.
Hearts beat as one, a symphony sweet,
Whispers of passion, love's rhythmic beat.

Eyes meet and linger, a silent vow,
Trust blooms like flowers, vibrant and now.
Hands reach for comfort, a touch so dear,
Chasing away shadows, banishing fear.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand they roam,
Building a future, making love their home.
Challenges faced with courage and grace,
Forever bound by love's enduring embrace.
