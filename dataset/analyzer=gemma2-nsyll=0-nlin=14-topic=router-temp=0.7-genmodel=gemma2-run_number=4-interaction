 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, data flowing free.
Connecting worlds, both near and far, between,
A digital bridge, for you and me.

Packets dance upon its circuits bright,
Through channels swift, a constant stream they ride.
From distant shores to screens bathed in soft light,
The router guides them, with unwavering stride.

No hero's cape, no fanfare at its call,
It works in silence, answering every plea.
A humble servant, standing strong and tall,
Ensuring connection, eternally.

So raise a glass, to this unsung device,
That binds us closer, through the digital ice. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
Connecting worlds where data streams take flight.
Invisible threads, secrets it does keep,
Guiding packets through the digital night.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a web of knowledge, vast and wide.
No hero's mantle, yet its power keen,
To bridge the gaps, on which our lives reside.

A silent guardian, ever watchful, true,
Ensuring every message finds its way.
A humble servant, steadfast, tried, and new,
The router's pulse keeps modern life at bay.

So let us thank this box, unseen, unheard,
For all the connections it has stirred.




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad I could help. Let me know if you have any other creative writing requests. 💻✍️ 😊
