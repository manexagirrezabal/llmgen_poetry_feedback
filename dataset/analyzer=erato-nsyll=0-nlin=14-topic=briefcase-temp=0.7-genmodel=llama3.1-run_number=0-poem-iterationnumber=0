A symbol of power, a tool of might,
The briefcase stands, a daily sight.
Leather-bound and sturdy as can be,
It holds the secrets of business decree.

With locks that click and zippers too,
It keeps its contents safe from view.
In crowded trains or on busy streets,
It's a familiar face, an office treat.

Inside, papers shuffle, pens do lie,
The weight of work, it does imply.
A briefcase is more than just a case,
It's a reflection of one's professional pace.

With every step, it takes its stand,
A trusted companion in the business land.
