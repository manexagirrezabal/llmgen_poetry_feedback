A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
As shadows lengthen 'neath a fading sky.
The body sleeps, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing,
In hearts that hold the love forever flowing.
And though the form departs, the spirit flies,
To realms unknown, beneath celestial skies.

So let us grieve not, for death's embrace is kind,
A peaceful slumber, leaving naught behind.
