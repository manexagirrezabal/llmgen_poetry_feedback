 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and shadows fill the space

As darkness reigns, the night says goodbye
The moon's pale glow, a beacon high
In the stillness, I wonder why
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
