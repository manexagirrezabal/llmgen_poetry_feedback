A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, a symphony
Of broken promises, tossed away.

The stench of rot, a bitter perfume,
A testament to excess and greed.
Nature weeps, consumed by this tomb,
As landfills swell, a silent creed.

But in the chaos, life finds its way,
Resilient creatures, scavenging near.
From waste we learn, a somber display,
Of choices made, both far and clear.

Let us mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And build a future where trash is banned.
