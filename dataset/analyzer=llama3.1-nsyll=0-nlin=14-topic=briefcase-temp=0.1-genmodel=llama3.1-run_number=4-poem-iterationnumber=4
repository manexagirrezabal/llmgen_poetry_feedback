A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets and offices all day long
Its contents unknown, yet full of weight
Decisions made, and deals to create

In meetings it's opened with care
Papers shuffled, and contracts shared
The briefcase is a trusted friend indeed
A loyal companion, through every deed

It holds the keys to success and fame
And in its depths, a story's claimed
With every step, a path is made
