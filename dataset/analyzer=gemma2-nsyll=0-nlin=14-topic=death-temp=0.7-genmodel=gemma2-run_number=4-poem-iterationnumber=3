The sun descends, a final golden kiss,
Upon the world, now cloaked in twilight's bliss.
A quiet hush falls over fields of green,
As nature sleeps, a tranquil, peaceful scene.

No more the bustling day, its hurried pace,
Just gentle breezes whispering through this place.
The weary soul finds solace in the night,
Released from burdens, bathed in soft moonlight.

A final breath escapes, a whispered sigh,
As stars ignite across the velvet sky.
And though the body rests in slumber deep,
The spirit journeys where true wonders sleep.

In realms of light, beyond our mortal sight,
