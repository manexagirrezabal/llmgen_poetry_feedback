 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds through digital streams.
Packets fly, a constant, coded dance,
Through wires spun, a technological trance.
From home to world, and back again,
The router spins, its purpose plain.
To bridge the gap, to make us one,
A web of data, brightly spun. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
