 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a gentle sigh,
The curtain falls, the soul takes flight.
No longer bound by earth and sky,
To realms unknown, it takes its might.
A silent sleep, a final rest,
Where memories bloom, forever blessed.
In fading light, a life well-pressed. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
