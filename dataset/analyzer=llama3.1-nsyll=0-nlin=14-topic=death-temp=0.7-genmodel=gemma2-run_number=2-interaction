 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
A silent hush descends upon the air.
No whispered words, no beating of a heart,
Just empty space where once a soul did dare.

A tapestry of life, now tightly wound,
Each thread unraveled, scattered to the breeze.
The vibrant hues that danced and brightly crowned,
Now fade to gray, beyond the shadowed trees.

But in the stillness, whispers can be heard,
Of memories cherished, laughter light and free.
A love enduring, a life well-revered,
Echoes linger, whispering eternally.

Though death may steal the body from our sight,
The spirit lives on, bathed in eternal light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
