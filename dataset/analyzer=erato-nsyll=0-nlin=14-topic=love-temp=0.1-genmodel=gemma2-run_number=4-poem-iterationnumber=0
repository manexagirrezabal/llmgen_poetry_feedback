A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to flow.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever understand.

Devotion deep, a treasure to behold,
A story whispered, never to grow old.
In every glance, a universe untold,
Love's symphony, a beauty to unfold.
Forever bound, their spirits intertwined,
A love that lasts, for all of time defined.
