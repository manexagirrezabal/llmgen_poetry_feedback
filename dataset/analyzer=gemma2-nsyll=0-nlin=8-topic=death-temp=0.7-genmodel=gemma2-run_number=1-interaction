 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent shroud, a final sleep,
Where whispers cease and shadows creep.
The heart that beat, now stilled and cold,
A story told, a life unrolled.
No dawn to greet, no sunset's glow,
Just endless night, where spirits go.
A mystery deep, beyond our ken,
Death's gentle touch, the end of when. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Let me know if there's anything else I can create for you.  ✍️✨
