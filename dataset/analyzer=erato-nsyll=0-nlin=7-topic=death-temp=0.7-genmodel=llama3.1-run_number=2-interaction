 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness claims the soul,
A final rest, a peaceful goal.
The heartbeat slows, the breath grows still,
Life's fleeting spark is lost in chill.
 Memories linger, then fade away,
In eternal sleep, all troubles stay.
Death's quiet whisper comes at end of day.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
