A humble box, unassuming in its place,
Yet holds the power to connect every space.
The router hums, a symphony of code,
Weaving threads of data, down a digital road.

From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam,
It sends and receives, fulfilling every dream.
A silent guardian, watching over all,
Ensuring voices rise and never fall.

No longer bound by miles or time's embrace,
We share our stories, find solace in this space.
The router stands, a steadfast friend indeed,
Connecting hearts and minds, a vital need.
