A spark ignited, a flame took hold,
Two souls entwined, a story untold.
Hearts beat as one, a symphony sweet,
A bond unbreakable, love's gentle heat.
Through laughter and tears, through sunshine and rain,
Love's tender embrace, easing every pain.
A promise whispered, forever to stay,
In this love's haven, where dreams hold sway.
