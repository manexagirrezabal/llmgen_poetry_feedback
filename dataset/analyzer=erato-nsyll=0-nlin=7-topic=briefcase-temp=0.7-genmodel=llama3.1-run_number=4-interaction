 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy case in hand
Holding secrets, plans, and demands
Business cards and papers neatly stacked
A symbol of power, yet humble in fact
The briefcase holds it all with care
A trusted companion for the daily share
Carrying dreams and deals with every stride.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about briefcases to your liking. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
