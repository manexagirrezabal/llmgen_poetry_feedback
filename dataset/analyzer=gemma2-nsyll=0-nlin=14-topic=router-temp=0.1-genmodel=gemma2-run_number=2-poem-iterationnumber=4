A box of circuits, humming soft and low,
The router stands, where data's currents flow.
It speaks in packets, whispers through the wires,
Connecting worlds, igniting digital fires.

From screens to phones, a web it does extend,
A silent guardian, till the very end.
No fanfare rings, no trumpets sound its praise,
Yet vital threads it weaves in countless ways.

A bridge of bits, a pathway for our minds,
Where thoughts and images transcend all binds.
So let us thank this humble, unseen friend,
Whose constant work connects us without end.
