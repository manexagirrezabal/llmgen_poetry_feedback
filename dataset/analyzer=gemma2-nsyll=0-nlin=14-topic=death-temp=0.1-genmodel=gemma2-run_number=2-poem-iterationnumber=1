The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A silent curtain falls upon our hearts.
No more the laughter, no familiar sound,
Just empty echoes where joy once was found.

But memories linger, like stars in night,
Guiding our steps through darkness and the light.
Though tears may fall, and grief may hold us tight,
Love's gentle embers burn with warming might.

For death is not an ending, but a change,
A passage to a realm beyond our range.
Where souls find solace, free from earthly pain,
And reunite in love's eternal reign.
