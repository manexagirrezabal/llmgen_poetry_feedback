 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets close, in hurried grasp.
Within its depths, ambitions lie,
Deals struck and dreams that soar so high.
From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
It carries weight, both light and feats.
A silent witness, ever near. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
