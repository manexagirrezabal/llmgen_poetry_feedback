 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting us all.
From distant screens to files shared with grace,
It weaves a web across time and space.
A gateway to worlds both near and far,
It grants access, shining like a star.
With packets swift, it dances through the wire,
Igniting dreams, fueling digital fire.
A symphony of bits, a constant flow,
Connecting hearts where stories grow.
Though hidden deep within its casing bright,
It guides our steps with unseen light.
So raise a glass to this humble machine,
The router's magic, forever keen.
