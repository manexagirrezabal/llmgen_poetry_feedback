 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it sits and waits,
Connecting worlds through digital gates.
Packets dance, a symphony unseen,
Bridging gaps, where data streams convene.
From distant lands to screens so near,
It weaves a web, dispelling fear.
The router's hum, a constant friend,
A modern marvel, without end. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ðŸ˜Š  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
