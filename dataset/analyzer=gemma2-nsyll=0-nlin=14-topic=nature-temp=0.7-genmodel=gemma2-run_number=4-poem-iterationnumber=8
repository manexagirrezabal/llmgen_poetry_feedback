Sunlight dapples through leaves of vibrant green,
A gentle breeze whispers where wildflowers convene.
Crimson petals unfurl, a delicate sight,
Butterflies dance in hues both warm and light.

Crystal streams meander, singing a sweet refrain,
Reflecting azure skies, erasing all pain.
Ancient trees stand tall, their branches reaching high,
Guardians of secrets whispered 'neath the sky.

As twilight descends, the sun paints the west,
Crimson hues ablaze, putting shadows to rest.
Stars begin to glimmer, diamonds in the night,
Nature's lullaby whispers, soft and bright.
