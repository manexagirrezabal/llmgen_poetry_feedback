Moonlight whispers secrets bright
Dance of shadows on the wall tonight
The stars up high, a twinkling sea
A celestial show for you and me

The world is hushed, in quiet sleep
Dreams are woven, memories to keep
In this still hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my soul's release

The night air whispers, soft and low
A lullaby, only known to few
The darkness hides, the light that's true
Yet in its depths, a beauty shines through

In moonlit hours, my heart is free.
