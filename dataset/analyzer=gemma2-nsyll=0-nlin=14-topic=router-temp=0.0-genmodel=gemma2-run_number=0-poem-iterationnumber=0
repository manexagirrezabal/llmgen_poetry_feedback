A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It speaks in packets, a language unknown,
Connecting worlds, making data flown.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a tapestry, vibrant and keen.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal to play,
It guides your journey, come what may.

But when it falters, the world slows its pace,
Frustration mounts, a digital disgrace.
Reboot, reset, a hopeful plea,
For connection restored, for you and for me.

Oh, humble router, your power untold,
A modern marvel, worth more than gold.
