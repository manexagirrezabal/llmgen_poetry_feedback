 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather case, so sturdy and strong
Holds secrets and papers all day long
In meetings it's present with pride
A symbol of success, side by side

The click of the lock, a satisfying sound
As the contents are kept safely bound
A haven for documents so fine
 Protected from prying eyes that design

With laptop and notes, it's always complete
A trusted companion, on every feat
Through corridors and halls, it's a familiar sight
A briefcase full of dreams, shining bright

In the evening, its work is done
Folded up tight, its day is won
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
