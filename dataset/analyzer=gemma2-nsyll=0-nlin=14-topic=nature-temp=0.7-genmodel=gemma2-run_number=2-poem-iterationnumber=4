Sunlight streams through branches, dappled gold,
Illuminating moss upon the forest floor.
A gentle breeze carries whispers untold,
As nature's symphony begins to soar.

Birdsong fills the air with melodies bright,
While squirrels scamper up ancient oak trees tall.
A babbling brook murmurs a tranquil sound,
Reflecting clouds that drift and softly fall.

The scent of pine and earth hangs in the air,
A tapestry of green, a vibrant hue.
In this serene embrace, all worries rare,
Nature's beauty whispers peace anew.
