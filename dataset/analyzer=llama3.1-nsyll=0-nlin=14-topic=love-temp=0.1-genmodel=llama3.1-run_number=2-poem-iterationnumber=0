Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A whispered promise that makes us whole.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In every moment, it will forever glow.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together facing life, beneath the golden sun.

Love is a journey, not a destination,
A path we walk together, hand in hand, with affection.
It's a choice we make each day to adore,
To cherish and support, to love evermore.

In love's sweet arms, our hearts find rest,
Forever entwined, our love will forever nest.
