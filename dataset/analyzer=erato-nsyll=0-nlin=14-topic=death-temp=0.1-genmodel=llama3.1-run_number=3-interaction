 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beat with love and fire
Now still, its warmth no longer dire
The eyes that shone like stars above
Grow dim, their light extinguished by love

In silence, death's dark form does creep
And takes the soul to eternal sleep
No pain, no fear, just peaceful rest
A release from life's tumultuous nest

Yet in our hearts, a memory stays
Of loved ones lost, and fleeting days.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
