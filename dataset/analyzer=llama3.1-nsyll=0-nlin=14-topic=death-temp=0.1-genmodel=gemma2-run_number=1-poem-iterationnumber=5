A gentle sigh escapes upon the breeze,
As life's last chapter softly finds release.
No more the laughter, tears that once did flow,
Just quiet peace where shadows gently grow.

The sun descends, a crimson kiss goodbye,
And stars ignite against the darkening sky.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
Of moments shared, and love's enduring run.

A tapestry of dreams, now softly spun,
Where earthly threads are gently overcome.
Though bodies rest, and spirits take their flight,
Love's gentle echo lingers in the night.
