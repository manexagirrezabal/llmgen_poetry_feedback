 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, secrets reside,
Deals struck, dreams both far and wide.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
It follows close, for fortune's sake.
A silent witness, ever near,
The briefcase whispers, "Success is here." 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
