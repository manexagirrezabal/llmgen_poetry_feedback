In darkness falls the silent guest,
A presence felt, yet unseen at best.
It claims the living with gentle hand,
And takes them home to a distant land.

Their memories linger, a bittersweet refrain,
Echoes of joy and love in vain.
The final breath is breathed, the heart does cease,
And death's dark shadow finds its peaceful release.
