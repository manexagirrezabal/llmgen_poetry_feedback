 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where dreams and shadows fill the space
The wind it howls, a lonely sigh
As darkness reigns, the night says goodbye
The stars up high, they twinkle fast
In this still hour, the heart finds rest at last
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
