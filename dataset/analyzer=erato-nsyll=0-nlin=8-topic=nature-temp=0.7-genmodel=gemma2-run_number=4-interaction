 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight streams through emerald leaves,
A symphony of birdsong weaves.
Gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Carrying scents on rustling seas.

Flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Butterflies dance, their wings infuse
The air with magic, pure and bright,
Nature's canvas, a wondrous sight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
