The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight paints shadows, stories untold.
A crimson leaf dances on breezes so light,
Autumn's embrace, a breathtaking sight.
Crisp air awakens with scents of decay,
Nature's grand finale, before winter's sway.
Beauty lingers, in this fleeting display.
