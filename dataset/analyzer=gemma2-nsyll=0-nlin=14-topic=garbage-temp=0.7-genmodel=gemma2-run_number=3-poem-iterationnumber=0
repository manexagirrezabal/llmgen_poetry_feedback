A plastic sea, where bottles drift and swirl,
A paper tide, where flyers twist and turn.
Cardboard castles crumble, dreams unfurled,
And cans like soldiers, rusted lessons learn.
The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
A landfill's breath, a noxious, bitter fume.
Forgotten feasts, now skeletons embraced
By maggots feasting on the moonlit gloom.
Oh, fragile Earth, beneath this mounting load,
Will beauty rise from this chaotic heap?
Or will we drown in mountains, ever flowed
With human folly, buried deep and steep?
A call to arms, a plea for mindful grace,
To leave a legacy, not waste's embrace.
