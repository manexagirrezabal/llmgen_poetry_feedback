A silver moon hangs high in velvet skies,
Casting its glow on sleeping fields and trees.
The crickets chirp their lullaby of ease,
While fireflies dance with twinkling, silent sighs.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of wildflowers, fresh and bright.
The world is hushed, enveloped in the night,
Where dreams take flight and shadows intervene.

Stars like diamonds scattered far and wide,
Twinkle above, a celestial guide.
And in this stillness, peace begins to bloom,
A quiet solace, banishing all gloom.

So let us rest beneath the moon's soft light,
And find contentment in the silent night.
