 > assistant: In twilight woods where shadows play,
The trees stand tall in gentle sway.
Their leaves rustle soft, a soothing sound,
As forest creatures roam around.

A brook babbles nearby, its voice so bright,
Reflecting sunbeams in shimmering light.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hue,
Dancing on the breeze, both old and new.

The scent of pine and earth fills the air,
Invigorating senses beyond compare.
In nature's realm, all worries fade,
And peace descends, a serene shade.

A sky ablaze with colors of gold,
Fades softly to a gentle night's hold.
Stars twinkle bright in an endless sea.
