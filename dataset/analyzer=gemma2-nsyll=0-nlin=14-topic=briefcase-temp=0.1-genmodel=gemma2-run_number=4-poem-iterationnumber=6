A briefcase, leather bound and sleek,
Holds dreams and schemes both bold and meek.
From boardroom battles to coffee's steam,
It travels with you, fulfilling your scheme.

Contracts signed, ambitions ignite,
Within its clasp, futures take flight.
A silent witness to every deal,
To triumphs won, and secrets revealed.

A symbol of power, or just a guide?
A faithful companion, by your side.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so tall,
A constant presence, answering your call.
