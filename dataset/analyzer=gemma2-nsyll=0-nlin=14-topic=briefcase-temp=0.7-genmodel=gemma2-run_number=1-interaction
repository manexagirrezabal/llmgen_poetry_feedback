 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A square of leather, worn and brown with age,
Holds secrets whispered in boardroom's din.
A symphony of meetings, deals engage,
And fortunes won within its rigid skin.

It sits beside a chair, a silent guard,
Of dreams and plans, ambitions yet untamed.
A weight it carries, both tangible and hard,
The burdens borne by those who've claimed their name.

From coffee shops to towering glass facades,
It marches forth, a symbol of the grind.
Through bustling streets, its presence seldom fades,
A constant fixture in our daily kind.

And though its contents may forever hide,
Its story echoes through the working tide. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a trusted friend indeed,
It holds ambitions, secrets it conceals.
Across the city, journeys it will lead,
A silent witness to success that steals

The spotlight from the weary and the bold.
Within its depths, contracts are signed and sealed,
With promises whispered, stories yet untold,
And futures forged, with hopes forever revealed.

It bears the weight of countless meetings held,
Of battles fought, and victories declared.
A symbol etched in time, a story spelled
In every dent, each scratch, each mark repaired.

A briefcase stands, a testament to drive,
To climb the ladder, and keep dreams alive. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Let me know if you have any other creative writing requests. ğŸ˜Š
