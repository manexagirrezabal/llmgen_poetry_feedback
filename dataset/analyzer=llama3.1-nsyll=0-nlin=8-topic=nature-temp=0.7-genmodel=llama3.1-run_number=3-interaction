 > assistant: Misty mountains rise to the sky
Waterfalls cascade, a soothing sigh
The forest sways, a gentle breeze
A haven for life, in quiet ease

Rivers flow, a winding stream
Reflecting sunbeams, a peaceful dream
Trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free
In harmony with nature's symphony
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something you enjoyed. If you want another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
