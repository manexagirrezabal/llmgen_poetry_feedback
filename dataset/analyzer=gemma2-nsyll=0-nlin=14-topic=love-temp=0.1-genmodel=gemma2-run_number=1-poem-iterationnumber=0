A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that's meant to know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

No words can capture, the depth of what they feel,
A tapestry woven, both strong and real.
Love's symphony plays, a melody so sweet,
A timeless treasure, their love complete.
