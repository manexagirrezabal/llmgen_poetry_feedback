 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where bottles and cans forever will be.
Leftover meals, wrappers, and broken toys,
A testament to our wasteful joys.

The stench hangs heavy, a noxious cloud,
As nature cries out, both weak and loud.
Landfills expand, a growing blight,
Consuming the earth with all its might.

But hope remains, a flicker so small,
To mend our ways, before we fall.
Recycle, reuse, reduce what we take,
For Earth's sake, for goodness' sake.

Let's turn the tide, this wasteful stream,
And build a future, clean and supreme.
