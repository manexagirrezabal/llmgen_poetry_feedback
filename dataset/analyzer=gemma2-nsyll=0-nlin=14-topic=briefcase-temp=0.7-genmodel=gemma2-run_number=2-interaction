 > assistant: A humble case of leather, brown and worn,
Holds secrets whispered, deals yet to be born.
It walks with purpose, strides both firm and swift,
Through crowded streets, a silent, steady gift.

Inside it lies ambition, dreams untold,
And plans that shape the stories to unfold.
A contract signed, a budget carefully planned,
The weight of futures held within its hand.

A symbol of success, or failure's sting,
It carries burdens, hopes it tries to bring.
From boardroom meetings to a humble door,
It travels onward, seeking something more.

A trusted companion, steadfast and true,
The briefcase waits, for what the day may brew. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a clasp of brass so bright,
It holds ambitions, secrets in plain sight.
Through bustling streets, a shadow on the ground,
The briefcase walks, its purpose to be found.

Inside it sleeps a world of hopes and fears,
Of deals negotiated, whispers through the years.
A contract penned, a vision taking flight,
The weight of futures held within its light.

It strides with owners, chasing day's demands,
A silent witness to their shaking hands.
Success or failure, etched upon its side,
The briefcase waits, where fortunes can be tied.

A constant fixture, steadfast and serene,
A story whispered, in the world unseen.

 > assistant: A leather shield, a clasp of burnished gold,
Holds dreams and secrets, stories yet untold.
Through city streets, it strides with silent grace,
A briefcase carries burdens time can't erase.

Within its depths, ambitions take their stand,
Contracts signed, a future in demand.
Success or failure, etched upon its side,
A weight of hopes, where destinies reside.

It walks with purpose, through the bustling crowd,
A silent witness to ambition proud.
From boardroom meetings to a humble door,
The briefcase journeys, seeking something more.

And when it rests, its secrets softly sleep,
Until tomorrow's dawn, and dreams run deep.
