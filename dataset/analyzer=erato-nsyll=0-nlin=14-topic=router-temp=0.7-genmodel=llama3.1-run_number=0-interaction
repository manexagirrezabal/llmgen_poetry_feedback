 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, a hero resides
A router's might, with signals it provides
Guiding packets through wires so fine
To their destinations, in digital time

With antennae tall, it reaches afar
Extending signals, near and from star
It connects the dots, in cyberspace wide
A bridge of bits, where data resides

Through NATs and firewalls, it shields the way
Protecting networks, night and day
Configured with care, its settings so bright
Ensuring stability, a beacon in sight

In the heart of homes, it quietly hums
Routing traffic, with digital drums
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
