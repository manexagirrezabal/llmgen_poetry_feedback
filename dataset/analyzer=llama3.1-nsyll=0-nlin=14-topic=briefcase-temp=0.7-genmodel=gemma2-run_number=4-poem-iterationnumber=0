A sentinel of steel, with leather skin,
It holds ambitions, dreams held deep within.
A silent partner in the daily grind,
Across the city streets, it leaves behind
A trail of whispers, secrets yet untold,
Of meetings won and battles fought and bold.

Inside its depths, a world of paper lies,
Contracts inked, with hopes that never die.
Proposals spun, with threads of silver bright,
And futures forged beneath the office light.
But when the day is done, it shuts its gate,
Awaiting dawn, and another twist of fate.
So sleek and strong, a symbol of our time,
The briefcase stands, a monument sublime.
