 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
A bond unbreakable, standing tall.
Through storms and sunshine, side by side,
Love's gentle touch, a constant guide.
Forever bound, in hearts aligned.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ✍️✨
