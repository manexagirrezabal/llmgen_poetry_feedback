A leather shell, a fortress built for dreams,
The briefcase holds ambition's flickering beams.
Through bustling crowds and sterile office floors,
It carries weight, unlocking hidden doors.

Inside its depths, a world of plans unfold,
Contracts signed, destinies bought and sold.
From boardroom battles to the lonely street,
It walks beside us, whispers secrets sweet.

A symbol etched in metal, strong and true,
The briefcase journeys with me and with you.
Through triumphs won and losses hard-fought fair,
It stands a constant presence, always there.
