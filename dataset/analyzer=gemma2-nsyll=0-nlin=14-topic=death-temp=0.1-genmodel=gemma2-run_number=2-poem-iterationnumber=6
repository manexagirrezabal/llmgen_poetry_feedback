A veil descends, the world grows soft and gray,
As life's bright tapestry begins to fray.
The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
And weary souls find solace in new starts.

But memories linger, like stars that gleam,
Reflecting moments lived in love's sweet dream.
Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud our sight,
Love's gentle embers burn with warming light.

For death is not an ending, but a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
And though we mourn the loss of those we knew,
Their essence lives within us, strong and true.
