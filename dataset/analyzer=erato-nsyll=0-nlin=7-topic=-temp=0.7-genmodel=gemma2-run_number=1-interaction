 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight dances, stories yet untold.
Crimson sunsets paint the fading sky,
As twilight's embrace draws near and nigh.
A lone bird sings, a melody so sweet,
A symphony of nature, bittersweet.
And stars ignite, a celestial light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other requests! 🎶🌳✨
