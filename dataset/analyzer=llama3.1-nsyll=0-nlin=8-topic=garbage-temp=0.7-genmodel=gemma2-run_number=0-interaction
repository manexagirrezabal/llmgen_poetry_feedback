 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where coffee cups and wrappers hide.
Forgotten toys and broken dreams,
Lost in mountains, it surely seems.
The Earth groans under weight so vast,
A future bleak, if not surpassed.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a legacy of clean, green land. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
