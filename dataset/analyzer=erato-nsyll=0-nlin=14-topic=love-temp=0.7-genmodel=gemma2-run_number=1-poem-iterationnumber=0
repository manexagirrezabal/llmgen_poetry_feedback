A spark ignited, a flame took hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, beneath skies so blue,
Whispered secrets, dreams coming true.

Hands that reach, hearts that beat as one,
A bond unbreakable, forever spun.
Through stormy nights and days of light,
Love's guiding star, shining ever bright.

No distance vast, no time can sever,
This connection deep, a love we treasure.
With every glance, a world unfolds,
In love's embrace, our story is told. 
A symphony of souls, forever free.
