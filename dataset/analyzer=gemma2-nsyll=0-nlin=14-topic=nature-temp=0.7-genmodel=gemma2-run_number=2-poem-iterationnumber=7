A golden sunbeam paints the morning dew,
Awakening the world with gentle light.
Birdsong fills the air, a melody anew,
As nature stirs and greets the day so bright.

The scent of pine and earth hangs in the breeze,
While butterflies on painted wings take flight.
Through ancient forests, sunlight softly flees,
Illuminating paths bathed in warm delight.

A babbling brook whispers secrets to the trees,
Reflecting clouds that drift across the blue.
In nature's embrace, a symphony of ease,
Where peace and beauty ever shine anew.
