 > assistant: Golden sunsets paint the sky,
As mountains stand, their grandeur high.
The forest whispers, leaves rustle free,
A gentle brook babbles, wild and carefree.
The scent of blooms, a sweet perfume,
Nature's beauty, forever in bloom.
Peaceful silence, wild and serene.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
