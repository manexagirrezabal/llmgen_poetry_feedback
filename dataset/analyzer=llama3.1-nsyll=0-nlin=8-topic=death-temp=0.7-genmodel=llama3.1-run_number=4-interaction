 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's shadow falls
A silence that echoes through all
The heart beats still, the breath is cold
Life's final whisper, young or old

 Memories linger, fading fast
A fleeting thought of what will last
In mortality's dark, endless sea
We're lost forever, wild and free
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic, just let me know.
