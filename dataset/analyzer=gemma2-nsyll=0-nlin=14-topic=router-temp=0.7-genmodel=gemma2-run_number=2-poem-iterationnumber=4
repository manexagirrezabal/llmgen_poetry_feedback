A box of circuits, humming softly low,
It spins a web where data comes and goes.
Packets race through wires, swift and unseen,
Connecting worlds, both distant and between.

From screens that glow to voices on the line,
It grants us access, making connections shine.
A silent guardian, ever watching near,
Ensuring signals travel clear and dear. 

The router stands, a sentinel of light,
Guiding information through the digital night.
No longer bound by distance, we can roam,
Thanks to its hum, bringing us back home.
