The moon hangs heavy, a pearl in the night,
Casting silver beams on the sleeping world's sight.
Stars like diamonds scattered across the dark,
Twinkling softly, leaving their ethereal mark.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying secrets that have yet to be seen.
Fireflies dance, tiny sparks of delight,
Illuminating shadows in the fading light.

Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
As nature slumbers, its secrets to keep.
The world holds its breath, in this tranquil hour,
A moment of peace, with ethereal power.

And dreams take flight, on wings of silver and gold,
Stories unfold, as the night's tale is told.
