A whisper soft, a breath that fades away,
The final curtain falls on life's bright play.
No more the laughter, tears, or joyful sound,
Just silence deep where peace is finally found.

A journey starts beyond the earthly veil,
To realms unknown, where spirits gently sail.
Though sorrow lingers, love will ever guide,
And memories warm us, side by side.

The tapestry unfurled, its colors bright,
Now rests in stillness, bathed in endless light.
Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever glean.

No longer bound by time's relentless tide,
In slumber deep, our souls forever reside.
