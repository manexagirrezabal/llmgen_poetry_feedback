 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Data streams flow, a digital tide,
Through wires and waves, it does preside.
From distant shores to screens nearby,
The router hums, a constant sigh.
Connecting worlds, with every byte. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
