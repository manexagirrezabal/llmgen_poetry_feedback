 > assistant: Moonlight dances on the sea,
A silver glow for you and me.
The stars up high, a twinkling show,
A celestial display, as the waves do flow.

The night air whispers secrets sweet,
As the world is hushed, in quiet sleep.
The moon's pale light, upon our face,
 Illuminates life, in a peaceful space.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something you enjoyed. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
