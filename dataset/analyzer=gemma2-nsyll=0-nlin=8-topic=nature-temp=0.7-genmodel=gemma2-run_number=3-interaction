 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sun-dappled leaves in emerald dance,
Whispering secrets on a summer trance.
A babbling brook, a melody so sweet,
Where dragonflies on painted wings do fleet.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues so bold,
A symphony of scents, stories untold.
Nature's embrace, a gentle, calming sigh,
Beneath the vast and endless, azure sky. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to explore any other creative writing ideas.  </span> </span>
