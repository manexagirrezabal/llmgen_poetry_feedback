A humble case of leather, brown and worn,
Holds secrets whispered, deals yet to be born.
It walks with purpose, strides both firm and swift,
Through crowded streets, a silent, steady gift.

Inside it lies ambition, dreams untold,
And plans that shape the stories to unfold.
A contract signed, a budget carefully planned,
The weight of futures held within its hand.

A symbol of success, or failure's sting,
It carries burdens, hopes it tries to bring.
From boardroom meetings to a humble door,
It travels onward, seeking something more.

A trusted companion, steadfast and true,
The briefcase waits, for what the day may brew.
