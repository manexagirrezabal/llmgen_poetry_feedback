A box of circuits, humming in the night,
Connecting worlds, with data's swift flight.
Through tangled wires, signals brightly gleam,
Weaving a tapestry, a waking dream.

From distant shores to screens that softly glow,
It shares our stories, helping spirits grow.
A silent guardian, ever watchful, true,
Guiding connections, old and fresh and new.

With every click, a world unfolds its grace,
In every message, smiles light up the space.
So let us praise this hero, small and bold,
The router's magic, worth more than silver or gold.
