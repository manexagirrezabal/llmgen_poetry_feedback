 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holding secrets, hopes, and grasps.
Across the city, it strides with grace,
A silent witness to time and space.
Within its depths, dreams take flight,
Deals are struck in dim office light,
The briefcase journeys, day and night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing prompt. ðŸ˜Š
