A sleek and shiny briefcase in hand
Carrying documents across the land
With locks and latches, it's secure and tight
Protecting papers from morning light

Inside its depths, a world is stored
Important files, both old and new explored
A symbol of work, of office pride
A tool for professionals to abide

Through meetings and negotiations, it's by our side
Helping us navigate with each step and stride
Its leather worn, its seams now thin
But still it serves, a faithful friend within

In the end, it's empty, its task complete
The contents gone, but memories still sweet
