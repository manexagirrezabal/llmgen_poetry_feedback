 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and secrets kept,
In whispered words, emotions swept.

A gentle touch, a knowing glance,
A silent promise, a loving dance.
Through storms they weather, side by side,
Their bond unbreakable, their love a guide.

With every sunrise, hearts anew,
A tapestry woven, strong and true.
Forever bound, in time's embrace,
Love's gentle rhythm, sets the pace.

Two souls as one, forever free. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 13 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a stolen glance,
A heart that beats, a joyful dance.
Two souls ignite, a flame so bright,
Guiding through darkness, into light.

With every touch, a spark ignites,
A symphony of love, taking flight.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Their bond unbreakable, standing tall.

In whispered secrets, dreams unfold,
A story written, never to grow old.
Forever bound, in time's embrace,
Love's gentle rhythm, sets the pace.

Two hearts entwined, a love so true.
