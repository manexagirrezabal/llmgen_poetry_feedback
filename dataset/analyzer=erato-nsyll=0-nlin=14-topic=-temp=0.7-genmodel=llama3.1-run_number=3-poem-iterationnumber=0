Silent moonbeams dance upon the sea
A midnight sky with stars set free
The world is hushed in quiet sleep
As darkness reigns and secrets keep

In hidden coves, the waves do play
Gently lapping at the sandy bay
Their soothing melody a lullaby sweet
That rocks the shore beneath their gentle beat

The night air whispers secrets to the trees
And they stand guard with leafy ease
Their branches swaying to the breeze's sigh
As the world slumbers on, passing by

In this still hour, all troubles cease
And peaceful calmness finds release.
