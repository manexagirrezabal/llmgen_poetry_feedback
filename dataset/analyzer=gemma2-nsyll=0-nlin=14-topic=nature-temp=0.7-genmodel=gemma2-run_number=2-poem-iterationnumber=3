Sunlight spills across the meadow bright,
Where wildflowers bloom in hues of gold and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so light,
And butterflies on painted wings are led

Across the field by scents of clover sweet,
While crickets chirp a rhythmic summer tune.
Tall grasses sway beneath the sun's warm heat,
And lazy clouds drift lazily at noon.

A symphony of nature fills the air,
With rustling leaves and birdsong clear and high.
The world is full of beauty everywhere,
If you just open your heart to nature's sigh.
