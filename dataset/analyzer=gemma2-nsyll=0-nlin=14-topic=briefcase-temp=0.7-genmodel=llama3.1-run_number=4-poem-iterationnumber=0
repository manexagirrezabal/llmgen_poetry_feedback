A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase holds secrets through day and night
Its leather worn, its seams now tight
A faithful companion, always in sight

It carries documents, contracts so fine
And proposals that are meant to shine
The weight it bears is often great and grand
As deals are made and fortunes expand

But sometimes empty, a hollow shell
A reminder of meetings that went well
Or perhaps a sign of failed design
A briefcase left behind, its purpose not divine

It sits upon the desk, a silent guest
Waiting for the next meeting to manifest
