 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets flow through its intricate design,
A web of signals, ever intertwine.
From home to office, school to distant shore,
It bridges gaps and opens every door.
The router hums, a tireless, steady beat,
Guiding information, making connections sweet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
