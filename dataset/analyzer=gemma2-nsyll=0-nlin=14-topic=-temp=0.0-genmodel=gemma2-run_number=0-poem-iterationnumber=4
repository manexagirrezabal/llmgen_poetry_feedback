The sun descends, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds with hues untold.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
As twilight's embrace brings a tranquil scene.

Stars begin to shimmer, one by one,
Their distant light, a celestial run.
The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting its glow across the velvet sky.

Nightingale's song fills the air with grace,
A symphony of sound in this quiet space.
Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
As nature slumbers, secrets to keep.
