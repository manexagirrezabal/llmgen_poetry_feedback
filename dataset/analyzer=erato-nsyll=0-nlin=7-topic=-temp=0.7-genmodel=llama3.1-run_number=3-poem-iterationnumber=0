Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep,
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep.
The forest whispers secrets to the trees,
A gentle breeze rustles through the summer's ease.
Fireflies flicker like tiny lanterns bright,
Stars up above shine with a soft, celestial light.
In this peaceful night, all worries cease.
