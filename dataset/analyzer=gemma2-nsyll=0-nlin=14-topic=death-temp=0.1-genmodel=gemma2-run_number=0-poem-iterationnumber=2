A whisper soft, a breath that fades away,
The final curtain falls on life's display.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just silent echoes in the morning dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life once lived, now memories unfold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits glide?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light.
