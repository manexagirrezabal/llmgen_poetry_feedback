 > assistant: The forest whispers secrets old
Of leaves that rustle, young and cold
A gentle brook babbles by my side
As sunbeams dance upon the tide

The trees stand tall, their limbs outstretched
Their branches swaying in a gentle sketch
The wind carries scents of earth below
And nature's beauty is forever to grow
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
