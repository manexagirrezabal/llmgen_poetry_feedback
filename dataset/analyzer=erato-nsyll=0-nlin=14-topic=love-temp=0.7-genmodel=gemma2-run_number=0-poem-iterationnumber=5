In whispered words and stolen glances bright,
Love's tender flame ignites, a beacon light.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
Finding solace in love's warm embrace.

With gentle touch and hearts that beat as one,
Their journey starts, beneath the golden sun.
Through laughter shared and dreams they hold so dear,
Love's tapestry weaves, banishing all fear.

A bond unbreakable, forged in time's sweet flow,
Two paths converge, where destinies bestow.
In love's eternal dance, their spirits entwine,
Forever bound, a love that will forever shine.
