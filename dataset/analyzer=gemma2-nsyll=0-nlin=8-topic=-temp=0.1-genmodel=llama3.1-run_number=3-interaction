 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls like a lonely sigh
As trees sway gently, rustling by
In this still hour, I find my peace
And let the world's wild beauty release
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something to your liking. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
