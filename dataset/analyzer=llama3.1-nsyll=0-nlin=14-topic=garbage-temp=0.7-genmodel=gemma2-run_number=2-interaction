 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea of wrappers, bags, and tins,
A symphony of scents both foul and sweet,
Where broken toys and wilting flowers spin
In swirling eddies, a forgotten treat.
The stench of rot, a chorus grimly sung,
By maggots feasting on decay's embrace.
A monument to waste, where dreams have flung
Themselves upon this desolate disgrace.
But even here, amidst the muck and mire,
A fragile sprout may pierce the hardened ground.
Hope whispers soft, a flickering desire,
That from this ruin, beauty can be found.
So let us mend our ways, with hearts anew,
And turn this tide of trash to something true. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
