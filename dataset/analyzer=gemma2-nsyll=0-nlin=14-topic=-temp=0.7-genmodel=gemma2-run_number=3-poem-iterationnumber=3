The sun descends, a fiery ball of light,
Kissing the clouds with hues of gold and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through the night,
As shadows lengthen, secrets softly spread.

Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Diamonds scattered on a velvet sheet.
The moon ascends, its silver journey spun,
Guiding lost souls with its ethereal heat.

Night's embrace descends, a tranquil sigh,
A world at rest, where worries gently sleep.
Silence prevails beneath the starlit sky,
And dreams take flight, their secrets to keep.

Peace descends, a blanket soft and deep,
Inviting weary hearts to slumber sweet.
