 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Trays and wrappers, discarded with ease

Forgotten treasures, lost to the sky
A world awry, in a sea of decay
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like more poems or have specific requests, feel free to ask!
