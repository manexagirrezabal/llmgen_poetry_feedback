A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
A whispered word, a touch that sets afire,
A longing gaze, a burning, sweet desire.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tender hand embraces one and all.
It conquers fear, it mends a broken heart,
A guiding light, a brand new work of art.

With every beat, a symphony unfolds,
A story whispered, secrets to be told.
In love's embrace, we find our truest self,
A sanctuary where joy and peace are felt.
Forever bound, two spirits intertwined,
Love's timeless magic, forever enshrined.
