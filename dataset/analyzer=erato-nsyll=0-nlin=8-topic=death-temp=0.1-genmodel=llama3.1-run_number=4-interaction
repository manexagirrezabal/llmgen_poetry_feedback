 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As life's last breath slips by

The heart that beats, now still and cold
 Memories of love, forever told
In darkness lies, the soul's release
Eternal rest, in endless peace
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
