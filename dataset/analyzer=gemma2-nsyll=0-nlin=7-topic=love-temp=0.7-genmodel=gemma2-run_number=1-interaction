 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignited, a flame took hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Through it all, love conquers all.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
A bond unbreakable, forever heard.
In love's embrace, we find our way. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests. âœ¨
