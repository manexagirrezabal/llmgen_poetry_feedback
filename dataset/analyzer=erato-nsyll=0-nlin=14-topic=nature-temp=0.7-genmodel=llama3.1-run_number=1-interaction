 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight woods, where shadows play,
The trees stand tall, in gentle sway.
Their leaves rustle soft, with summer breeze,
As sunbeams filter through the trees.

A brook babbles on, its crystal song,
Echoing through the forest long.
Wildflowers bloom, in vibrant hue,
Dancing in wind, both old and new.

The mountains rise, in rugged might,
Their peaks reaching for the morning light.
A flock of birds, in chorus sing,
As nature's beauty starts to spring.

In this wild scene, I find my peace,
A sense of calm, my soul's release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was a pleasure to create the poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
