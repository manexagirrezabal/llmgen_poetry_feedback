 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a gentle touch,
Sparks ignite, a burning clutch.
Hearts entwined, a silent vow,
Two souls unite, here and now.
Through laughter bright and tears that fall,
Love's steady hand holds us through it all.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
Forever bound, me and you.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊 🎶  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!  ✨
