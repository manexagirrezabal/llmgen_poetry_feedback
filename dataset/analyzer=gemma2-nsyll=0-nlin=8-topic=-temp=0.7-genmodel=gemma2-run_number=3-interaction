 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
In velvet skies, where shadows appear.
A whisper of wind through leaves so frail,
A symphony hushed, a nocturnal tale.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Guiding lost souls through the silent night.
Dreams take flight on wings unseen,
As slumber claims all, serene and clean. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
