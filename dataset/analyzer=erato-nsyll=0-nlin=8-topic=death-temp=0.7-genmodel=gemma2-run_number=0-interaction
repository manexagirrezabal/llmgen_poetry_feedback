 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent hush descends the air,
A final breath, a whispered prayer.
The body stills, a weary sigh,
And life's bright flame begins to die.
But in the darkness, softly light,
A new beginning takes its flight.
For death is not an ending cold,
But passage to a story untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to explore another creative writing project!
