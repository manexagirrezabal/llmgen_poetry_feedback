 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic crown upon a crumpled can,
A paper throne of takeout trays piled high,
A symphony of whispers, a silent plan
For landfills vast that reach to the sky.
The remnants of our wants, desires tossed,
Forgotten dreams in wrappers, bright and bold,
A tapestry of waste, at what cost?
This legacy we leave, a story told
In broken bottles, tangled wires' gleam,
And screens now silent, voices hushed and still.
We built this mountain, fueled by fleeting whim,
But nature waits, with patient, watchful will.
Will we find balance, mend the fractured whole,
Or drown beneath the weight of our control? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
