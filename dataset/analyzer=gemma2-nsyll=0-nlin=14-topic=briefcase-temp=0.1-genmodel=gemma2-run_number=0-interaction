 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom meetings to coffee shop chats,
It's a constant companion, ever near.
A symbol of success, where fortune sits,
Or failure's shadow, casting doubt and fear.

The click of latches, a familiar sound,
As papers rustle, plans unfold with care.
A silent witness to triumphs all around,
And moments lost in time beyond compare.

So raise a glass to this humble case,
A vessel for our lives, in every space.
