The final breath, a whisper on the breeze,
A fading light that softly disappears.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just quiet peace, where shadows gently come.

The world moves on, oblivious and bright,
While stars above reflect a somber night.
But in the stillness, memories take flight,
Of laughter shared, and love's enduring light.

A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now rests in silence, where all things entwine.
Though earthly bonds may break and spirits fly,
Love's echo lingers, reaching for the sky.

And though we grieve, a whisper fills the air:
"Life's not an ending, but a journey rare."
