 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets close, in hurried grasp.
From boardroom walls to city streets,
It carries dreams and anxious feats.
A silent witness, sleek and strong,
To deals made swift, where right meets wrong.
The weight of words, the burden borne,
Within its depths, a future sworn. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
