A leather shell, worn smooth by time's embrace,
Holds secrets whispered in a hurried pace.
Within its depths, ambition takes its stand,
Deals struck and dreams held tightly in hand.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop talks,
It carries burdens, answers life's hard walks.
A silent witness to triumphs and fears,
The briefcase travels through the passing years.

Its clasp clicks shut, a finality sound,
Leaving behind the chaos it has found.
A symbol of progress, a tool of trade,
In its embrace, fortunes are made.
