A plastic tide, a metal sea of waste,
Where dreams are buried, hopes begin to rust.
Forgotten wrappers, cardboard's brittle taste,
A silent graveyard where our future must

Be questioned now, as mountains rise so high.
The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid breeze.
We built our empires on this fragile lie,
And left behind a world that cannot please.

Can we not learn from this discarded heap?
To mend the Earth, to heal the wounds we've made?
Let us reclaim what we have cast asleep,
And build a future where no trash is laid.

A cleaner world, a brighter day awaits,
If only we will choose to change our fates.
