 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy case of leather worn,
A symbol of success, or so it's sworn.
 Inside its depths, papers and files do lay,
Important documents, in a careful way.

It rides by one's side, with each busy stride,
A trusted companion, through work's tide.
Its metal clasps hold tight, with a reassuring sound,
A briefcase's purpose, is always to be found.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create the poem about the briefcase for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
