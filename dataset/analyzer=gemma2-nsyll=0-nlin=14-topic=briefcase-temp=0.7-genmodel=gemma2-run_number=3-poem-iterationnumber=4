A leather shell, a fortress dark and deep,
It guards the secrets dreams and futures keep.
From boardroom wars to city's hurried pace,
It walks beside, a constant, trusted face.

With every click, a promise softly made,
Of deals secured, and fortunes to be swayed.
But sometimes closed, beneath its somber sheen,
It whispers tales of what has been, unseen.

A silent witness to ambition's climb,
Through triumphs won, and moments lost in time.
So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase strong, until the very end.
