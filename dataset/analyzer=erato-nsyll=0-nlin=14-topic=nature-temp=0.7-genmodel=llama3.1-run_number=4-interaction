 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks touched by the golden light.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its peaceful dream.

The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
A haven for the creatures unseen.
The birds sing sweet, their melodies so bright,
Filling my heart with wonder and delight.

In nature's arms, I find my peace,
A sense of calm that the world can't release.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that you enjoyed. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
