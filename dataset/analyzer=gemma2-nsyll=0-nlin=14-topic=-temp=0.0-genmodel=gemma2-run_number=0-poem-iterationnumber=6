The old stone bridge arches over the stream,
A silent witness to life's fleeting dream.
Timeworn and weathered, yet standing strong,
It whispers tales of days gone by, and songs.

Sunlight dances on the water's flow,
Reflecting clouds that drift and come and go.
Birds sing sweetly from branches overhead,
While leaves rustle softly, secrets they spread.

A gentle breeze carries scents of pine and earth,
As nature's beauty unfolds its worth.
The bridge endures, a symbol of time's flight,
Connecting past and present, in the fading light.
