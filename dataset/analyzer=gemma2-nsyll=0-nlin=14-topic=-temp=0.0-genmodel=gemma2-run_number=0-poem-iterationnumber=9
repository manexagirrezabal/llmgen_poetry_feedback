A lone wolf howls beneath a silver moon,
His mournful cry echoes through the silent wood.
Stars shimmer above, in a tapestry of light,
As shadows dance and twist throughout the night.

The forest sleeps, wrapped in an ethereal haze,
While owls call softly, in their ancient ways.
A gentle breeze rustles through the leaves so high,
Carrying scents of pine and earth, as moments fly.

The wolf's lament hangs heavy in the air,
A song of longing, a tale of love and care.
He seeks his pack, beneath the starry dome,
Finding solace in their presence, far from home.
