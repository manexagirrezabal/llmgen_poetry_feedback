A leather shell, a trusted friend indeed,
It holds ambitions, secrets it conceals.
Across the city, journeys it will lead,
A silent witness to success that steals

The spotlight from the weary and the bold.
Within its depths, contracts are signed and sealed,
With promises whispered, stories yet untold,
And futures forged, with hopes forever revealed.

It bears the weight of countless meetings held,
Of battles fought, and victories declared.
A symbol etched in time, a story spelled
In every dent, each scratch, each mark repaired.

A briefcase stands, a testament to drive,
To climb the ladder, and keep dreams alive.
