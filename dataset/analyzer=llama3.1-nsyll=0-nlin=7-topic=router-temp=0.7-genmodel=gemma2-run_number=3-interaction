 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it sits unseen,
A web of wires, its domain pristine.
Packets flow through, a digital stream,
Connecting worlds, fulfilling every dream.
From distant shores to homes so near,
It bridges gaps, dispelling all fear.
The router hums, a network's heart sincere. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!
