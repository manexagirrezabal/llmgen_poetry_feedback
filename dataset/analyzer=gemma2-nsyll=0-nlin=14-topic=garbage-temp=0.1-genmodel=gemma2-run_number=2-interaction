 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, a symphony
Of broken promises, tossed away.

Glass shards glitter like fallen stars,
Metal cans whisper tales of meals consumed.
Paper ghosts dance in the wind's harsh bars,
Their stories silenced, forever doomed.

A landfill's heart, a festering wound,
Where nature weeps and creatures flee.
A testament to what we have found,
And lost along the way, you see.

Let us mend our ways, with mindful hand,
To heal this earth, reclaim our land.

 > assistant: A plastic tide, a metal sea,
Where dreams are buried, hopes decay.
Forgotten wrappers, carelessly free,
Whispering tales of yesterday.

Glass shards glitter, sharp and cold,
Paper ghosts dance in the wind's embrace.
Metal cans, stories untold,
Lost in this refuse-filled space.
