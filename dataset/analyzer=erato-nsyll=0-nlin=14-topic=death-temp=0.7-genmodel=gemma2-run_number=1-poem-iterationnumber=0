The final curtain falls, a whispered sigh,
A dimming light, where shadows softly lie.
No more the pulse that beat a steady drum,
No laughter rings, no stories to be spun.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories dance within a loving breast.
A journey ends, a chapter closed at last,
The fleeting moments, bittersweet and fast.

But though the form may fade from earthly sight,
The essence lingers, bathed in endless light.
In whispered tales and stars that softly gleam,
A soul endures, a timeless, vibrant dream.

And so we grieve, yet find a peace profound,
For life's embrace will ever hold us bound.
