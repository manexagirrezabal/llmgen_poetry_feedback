 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Mounds of trash, a dismal sight
Rotting food and broken light
Cans and bottles, discarded care
The earth protests with polluted air
We reap what we sow, in plastic's sway
A world suffocating, day by day
Garbage's grip, on our future's fate
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about a timely and important topic. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
