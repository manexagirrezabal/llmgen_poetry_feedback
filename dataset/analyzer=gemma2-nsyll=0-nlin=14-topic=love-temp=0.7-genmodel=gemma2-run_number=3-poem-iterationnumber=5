A whispered word, a glance that speaks untold,
Two souls ignite, a story to unfold.
A gentle touch, a fire softly starts,
A symphony of love, within their hearts.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Their bond grows stronger, standing tall.
With every sunrise, love's embrace anew,
A tapestry of dreams, forever true. 

In quiet moments, whispers fill the air,
Two souls entwined, a love beyond compare.
Forever bound, their destinies aligned,
A timeless dance, in hearts and minds combined.
Their love endures, a flame that burns so bright.
