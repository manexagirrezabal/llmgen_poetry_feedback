In twilight's hush where shadows play,
The stars come out to dance and sway,
A midnight sky with diamonds bright,
Reflects the beauty of the endless night.

The world is still, in quiet sleep,
As moonlight whispers secrets deep,
The wind stirs not, nor rustles tree,
In this peaceful moment, all is free.

The darkness reigns, yet light prevails,
For in its depths, a beauty sways,
A gentle calm that soothes the soul,
And in its stillness, love makes whole.

The night's dark veil, a mystery holds,
Yet in its heart, a magic unfolds.
