The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Dancing in the breeze, a gentle sight.

The river flows with waters deep,
Reflecting beauty, as it slowly creeps.
The mountains rise with peaks so high,
A majestic landscape, touching the sky.
