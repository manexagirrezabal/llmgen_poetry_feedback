 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In wired world of data and speed,
A humble hero quietly proceeds.
The router directs with careful might,
Connecting all through day and night.

It balances load with gentle touch,
And keeps our online lives in such a clutch.
With Wi-Fi waves that spread so wide,
It brings the internet to our side.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something helpful for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
