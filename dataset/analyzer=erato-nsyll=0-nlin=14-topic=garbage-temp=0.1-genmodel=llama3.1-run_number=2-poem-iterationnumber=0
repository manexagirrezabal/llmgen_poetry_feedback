In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Lies trash that's discarded with pride.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't you know?
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A mountain high, a dismal fact.

The oceans choke on plastic's might,
And creatures suffer through the night.
We must reduce, reuse, and recycle too,
To save our planet, me and you.

Let's take responsibility for what we throw,
And strive to live in a world that glows.
