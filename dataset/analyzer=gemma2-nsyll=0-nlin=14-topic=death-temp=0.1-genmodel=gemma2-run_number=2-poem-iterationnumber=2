A hush descends, the world grows still and gray,
As life's bright flame flickers and fades away.
The final breath escapes on silent wings,
And weary eyes no longer see what sings.

But in the stillness, memories take flight,
Like stars that shimmer in the darkest night.
A gentle warmth remains, a love untold,
That binds our hearts, though stories now grow cold.

Though tears may fall and sorrow fills the air,
Hope's tender light shines ever bright and fair.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
