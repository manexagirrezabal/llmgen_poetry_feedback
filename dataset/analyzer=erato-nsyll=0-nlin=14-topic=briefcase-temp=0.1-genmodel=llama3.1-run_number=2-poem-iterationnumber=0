A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a daily sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through crowded streets, all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery hidden, yet to unfold

In meetings and deals, it plays its part
A trusted companion, a loyal heart
It holds the weight of business and fate
And keeps the secrets, that must not abate

With every step, it's by your side
A faithful friend, through work and pride
