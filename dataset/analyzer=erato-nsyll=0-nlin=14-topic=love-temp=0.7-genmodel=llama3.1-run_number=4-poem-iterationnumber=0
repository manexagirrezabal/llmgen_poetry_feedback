Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It chases fears and calms the soul,
Bringing peace to make our hearts whole.

In love's sweet touch, we find our home,
A place where we are never alone.
With every kiss, our love grows strong,
Together forever, right or wrong.

Love's beauty shines like a work of art,
Creating moments that capture the heart.
It whispers secrets in our willing ear,
And with each passing year, it draws near.

In love's pure light, our hearts entwine,
Forever bound by a love divine.
