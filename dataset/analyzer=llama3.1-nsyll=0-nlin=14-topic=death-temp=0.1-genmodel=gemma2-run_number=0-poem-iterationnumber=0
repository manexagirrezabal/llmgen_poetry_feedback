A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes in the morning dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life once bright, now fading, growing cold.
But memories linger, like embers in the night,
Guiding stars that pierce the endless blight.

Though bodies slumber, spirits take their flight,
To realms unknown, bathed in ethereal light.
And though we grieve, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's gentle touch will ease the mournful strain.

For death is not an ending, but a start,
A passage through the veil, to mend a broken heart.
