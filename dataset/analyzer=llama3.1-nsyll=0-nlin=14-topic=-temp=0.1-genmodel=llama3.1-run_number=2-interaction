 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
As stars above their vigil keep and fill

The night air whispers secrets to the trees
Their leaves a gentle susurrus, soft as breeze
The wind stirs not, yet rustles through the grass
A soothing melody that calms the pass

In this peaceful hour, I find my rest
My heart and soul, in quiet, are blessed
The world's loud din and chaos left behind
As I surrender to the stillness of the mind

And in the darkness, I am free to roam
Where shadows dance and stars are my sweet home
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad you enjoyed the poem. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
