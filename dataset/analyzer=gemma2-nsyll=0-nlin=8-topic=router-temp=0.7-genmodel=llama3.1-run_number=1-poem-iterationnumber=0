In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where data abides
It routes the signals, with precision and care
A behind-the-scenes work, that's always fair
With wires and routers, it weaves its way
Through internet realms, night and day
A quiet guardian, of our digital space
Keeping us connected, in a virtual place
