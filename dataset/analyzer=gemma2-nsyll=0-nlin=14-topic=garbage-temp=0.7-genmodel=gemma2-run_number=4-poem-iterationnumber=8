A plastic tide engulfs us, bottles sway,
Forgotten wrappers whisper tales of yesterday.
Cans rust and tarnish, dreams lost on display,
In overflowing bins where hopes decay.

The stench of rot, a symphony of grime,
Where nature's balance teeters on the climb.
Landfills grow, consuming space and time,
A silent burden on this earthly rhyme.

But even here, a stubborn flower blooms,
Amidst the refuse, dispelling all our glooms.
A fragile hope, defying all our tombs,
To mend our ways, and banish waste's fumes.
