A leather shield, a clasp of burnished gold,
Holds dreams and secrets, stories yet untold.
Through city streets, it strides with silent grace,
A briefcase carries burdens time can't erase.

Within its depths, ambitions take their stand,
Contracts signed, a future in demand.
Success or failure, etched upon its side,
A weight of hopes, where destinies reside.

It walks with purpose, through the bustling crowd,
A silent witness to ambition proud.
From boardroom meetings to a humble door,
The briefcase journeys, seeking something more.

And when it rests, its secrets softly sleep,
Until tomorrow's dawn, and dreams run deep.
