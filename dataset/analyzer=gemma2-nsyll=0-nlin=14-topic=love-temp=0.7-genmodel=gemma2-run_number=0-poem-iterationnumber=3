A whispered word, a gentle touch so light,
Ignites a spark, a flame burns ever bright.
Two hearts entwined, in love's sweet embrace,
A symphony of souls, in time and space.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Love's tender touch transcends us all.
A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust,
Forever bound, in love we must.

With every glance, a story unfolds,
Two souls united, as destiny beholds.
In love's sweet haven, hearts find their way,
Forever cherished, come what may.
