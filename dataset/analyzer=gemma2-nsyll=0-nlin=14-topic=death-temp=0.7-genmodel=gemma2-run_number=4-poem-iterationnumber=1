A quiet hush falls on the world at last,
The beating heart grows still, its rhythm ceased.
A shadow creeps across the fading past,
And weary eyes find final, peaceful rest.

No more the bustling day, the sun's bright gaze,
But gentle twilight whispers in the breeze.
A tapestry of moments fades and sways,
As life surrenders to eternal ease.

Yet memories linger, like a whispered name,
A spark of love that time cannot erase.
And though the body sleeps, untouched by flame,
The soul ascends, to find its rightful place.
