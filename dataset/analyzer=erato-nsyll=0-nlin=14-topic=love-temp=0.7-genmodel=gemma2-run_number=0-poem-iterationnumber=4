A single touch, a spark ignites,
Two hearts entwined in love's soft lights.
A whispered word, a silent vow,
Love's melody, here and now.

Through fields of green, beneath skies so blue,
Their love unfolds, forever true.
Hand in hand, they walk life's way,
Chasing dreams with each passing day.

With every glance, a world anew,
Two souls connected, strong and true.
In love's embrace, they find their bliss,
A timeless journey, sealed with a kiss.
