In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms so fine
Receiving and sending, in perfect time
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, to the digital thread

With Wi-Fi waves, it casts its gentle might
Inviting all to join, in its network's light
A beacon of access, in a world so wide
The router stands watch, as data flows inside

In our homes and offices, it's always near
A constant presence, that banishes fear
