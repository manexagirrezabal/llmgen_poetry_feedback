 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness falls, a final sleep
Death's gentle hand, our souls to keep
A fleeting life, a moment's breath
Ephemeral dreams, of earthly wealth

The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows weak
The light fades out, and all is meek
In death's stillness, we find release
From mortal coils, eternal peace
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
