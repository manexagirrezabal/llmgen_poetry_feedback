 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams to weave their mystic will

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display, as the hours flow
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall
And night's sweet peace, begins to enthrall

In this quiet hour, the heart can roam
Free from the din, of the world's loud home
Where worries fade, and love shines bright
And in the darkness, a light takes flight

The night's dark veil, is lifted high
Revealing beauty, that touches the sky
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
