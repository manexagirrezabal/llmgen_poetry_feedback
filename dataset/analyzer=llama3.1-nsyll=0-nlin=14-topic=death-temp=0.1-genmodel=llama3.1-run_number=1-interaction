 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beat with love and fire
Now stills its pulse, its warmth expires
The eyes that shone like stars above
Grow dim, their light extinguished by love

In silence, darkness claims the soul
And all that lived, now makes its role
A fleeting thought, a memory stays
Of life's brief dance, in endless days

Yet even death, cannot erase
The love and joy that time and space
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
