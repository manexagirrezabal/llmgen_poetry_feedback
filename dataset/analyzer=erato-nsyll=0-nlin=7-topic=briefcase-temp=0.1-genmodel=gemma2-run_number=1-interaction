 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Within it secrets, dreams amassed.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
It carries burdens, hopes it takes.
A silent witness, ever near,
To triumphs won and doubts held dear.
The briefcase waits, its story untold. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
