 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather briefcase, worn and old
Holds secrets and stories yet untold

Inside its depths, papers shuffle and sway
The rustle of pages, a daily fray
In the morning light, it's carried away
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
