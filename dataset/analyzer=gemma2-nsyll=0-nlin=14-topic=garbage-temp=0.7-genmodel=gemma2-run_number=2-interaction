 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where wrappers dance and bottles twist with glee.
Forgotten meals and dreams left to decay,
A symphony of stench, where colors gray.
Once cherished objects, now cast aside,
In this wasteland where hope has gone to hide.
A silent testament to careless ways,
The burden we bear in these modern days.
But even in refuse, a story unfolds,
Of lives lived, choices made, and hearts grown cold.
Can beauty bloom from this decaying mass?
Can lessons learned transform the waste we amass?
Perhaps within this mess, a chance to mend,
To be mindful stewards, until the very end.
