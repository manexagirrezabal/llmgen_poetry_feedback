A plastic tide, where bottles softly drift,
And crumpled cans tell stories of our thrift.
Forgotten lunches, dreams that came to shift,
In overflowing bins, a silent gift.

The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
Where nature's balance struggles to embrace.
Landfills grow, consuming time and space,
A heavy burden on this fragile race. 

But even here, a resilient sprout appears,
Amidst the refuse, quelling all our fears.
A fragile hope, dispelling doubt and tears,
To mend our ways, and conquer waste's snares.
