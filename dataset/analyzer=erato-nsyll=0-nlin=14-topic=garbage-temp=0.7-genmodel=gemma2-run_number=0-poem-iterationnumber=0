A mountain of refuse, a stinking blight,
Where plastic and paper fight in endless night.
A canvas of cans, a tapestry of waste,
A monument to our insatiable taste.

Forgotten wrappers, bottles tossed aside,
The remnants of meals, where dreams once resided.
Once vibrant hues now fade into gray,
As nature weeps for what has gone astray.

But hope flickers bright in compost's embrace,
Where decay transforms with a gentle grace.
A cycle reborn, a lesson to learn,
To cherish our Earth and lessen the burn.

Let's mend our ways, reduce, reuse, and mend,
And turn this mountain into a greener trend.
