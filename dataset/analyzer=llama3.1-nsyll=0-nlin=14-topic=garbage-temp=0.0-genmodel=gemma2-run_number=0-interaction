 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and wrappers, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature's light gives way.

The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid smell,
As creatures scurry through the broken glass.
A silent testament to stories fell,
Forgotten treasures, time cannot surpass.

We build our empires on this fragile ground,
And leave behind a legacy of pain.
Can we not learn, can we not turn around?
To mend the Earth, before it's all in vain?

Let us reclaim what we have cast away,
And build a future where trash finds its day. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 18 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic tide, a metal sea of waste,
Where dreams are buried, hopes begin to rust.
Forgotten wrappers, cardboard's brittle taste,
A silent graveyard where our future must

Be questioned now, as mountains rise so high.
The stench of rot, a bitter, acrid breeze.
We built our empires on this fragile lie,
And left behind a world that cannot please.

Can we not learn from this discarded heap?
To mend the Earth, to heal the wounds we've made?
Let us reclaim what we have cast asleep,
And build a future where no trash is laid.

A cleaner world, a brighter day awaits,
If only we will choose to change our fates. 



 > human: Thank you!
