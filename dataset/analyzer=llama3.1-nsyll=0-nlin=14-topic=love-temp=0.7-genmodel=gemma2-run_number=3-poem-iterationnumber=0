A spark ignites, a flicker in the night,
Two souls entwined, bathed in love's soft light.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A symphony of hearts, a rhythmic beat.

Through laughter shared and tears that softly fall,
Love's tender embrace encompasses all.
It conquers fear, dissolves each doubt and pain,
A boundless ocean where true feelings reign.

With every sunrise, love's flame burns anew,
A promise whispered, forever strong and true.
In moments cherished, hand in loving hand,
Two lives united, on life's fertile land.

So let us celebrate this gift so rare,
Love's eternal magic, beyond compare.
