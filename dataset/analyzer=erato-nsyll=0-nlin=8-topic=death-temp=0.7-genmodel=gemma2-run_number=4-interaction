 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a final sigh,
The curtain falls, the lights go low.
A silent dance, beneath the sky,
Where memories gently ebb and flow.

A life well lived, a story told,
In hearts that hold both joy and pain.
Though flesh may fade, and dreams grow cold,
Love's embers burn, like sunlit rain. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š  I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
