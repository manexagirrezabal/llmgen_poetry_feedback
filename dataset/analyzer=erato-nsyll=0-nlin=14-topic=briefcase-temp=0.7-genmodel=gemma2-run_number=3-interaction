 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather womb, with clasps of polished steel,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily toil.
Within its depths, ambitions subtly reel,
And plans for futures, whispered, take their soil.

A silent sentinel, it stands at hand,
A symbol of success, or looming dread.
Across the city streets, a steady band
Of briefcase bearers march, thoughts in their head.

Each meeting held, each deal that's struck or lost,
Is etched upon its surface, worn and thin.
The stories whispered, at what heavy cost?
A life defined by victories within.

But when the day is done, its clasp released,
It sleeps, a humble shell, finding sweet peace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š   Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
