The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Leaves dance in breezes, rustling whispers loose,
As twilight shadows stretch and gently snare.

A silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Stars begin to twinkle, bright and bold,
Fireflies ignite, like tiny sparks on high,
And crickets chirp their stories, soft and old.

The scent of pine and earth upon the breeze,
A gentle stream murmurs its tranquil song,
Nature's lullaby, bringing hearts at ease,
Where worries fade and peace belongs.

In this embrace, a moment pure and sweet,
Where life's complexities gently retreat.
