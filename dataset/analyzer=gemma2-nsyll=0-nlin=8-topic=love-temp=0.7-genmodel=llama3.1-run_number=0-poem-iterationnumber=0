Soft whispers in the dead of night
A gentle touch that sets my soul alight
Love's flame burns bright and true and free
Melting fears and doubts in ecstasy

In your eyes, my heart finds a home
With you, I am never far from love's sweet tone
Together we'll dance beneath the starry sky
Forever entwined, our hearts beating high
