A whispered hush, a final breath held tight,
The world fades out, replaced by endless night.
No pain, no fear, just stillness in its place,
A vacant shell, an empty, silent space.
But life's echoes linger, whispers on the breeze,
Of laughter shared, and moments meant to please.
A tapestry woven with threads of joy and grief,
Now folded neatly, finding final relief.
Though bodies crumble, spirits soar above,
A journey taken, guided by unseen love.
Beyond the veil, where mysteries reside,
New paths unfold, on which our souls can glide.
So fear not death, its touch a gentle hand,
That leads us homeward to a promised land.
