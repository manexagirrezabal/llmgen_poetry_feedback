 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A silent story, sadly played.
The earth groans under weight of waste,
A future choked, a bitter taste.
Let's mend our ways, with mindful hand,
And leave a world where beauty can stand. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
