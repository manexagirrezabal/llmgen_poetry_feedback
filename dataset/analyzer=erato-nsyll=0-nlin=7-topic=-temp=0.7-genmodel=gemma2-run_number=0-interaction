 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight dances on a path yet untold.
A symphony of autumn, crisp and bright,
Where shadows lengthen in fading light.
Crimson hues paint the canvas of day,
As nature sleeps, and worries melt away.
A gentle stillness settles, soft and deep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you'd like to see another one.  âœ¨
