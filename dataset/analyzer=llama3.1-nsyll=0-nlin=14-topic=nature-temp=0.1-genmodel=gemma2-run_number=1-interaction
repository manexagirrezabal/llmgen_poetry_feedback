 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
While fireflies ignite, like scattered jewels,
And shadows dance, beyond compare.

The whispering wind through leaves a lullaby,
A gentle breeze that carries scents so sweet,
Of blooming flowers reaching for the sky,
And mossy stones where tiny creatures meet.

The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting its glow upon the sleeping land,
Stars twinkle bright, against the velvet night,
A tapestry of wonder, close at hand.

Nature's embrace, a solace and delight,
Where peace resides, both day and darkest night.

 > assistant: Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets untold,
Flowers unfurl, a vibrant, colorful scene,
As nature's beauty unfolds.

Birdsong fills the air, a sweet refrain,
Butterflies dance on wings of painted grace,
A babbling brook murmurs, easing every pain,
Reflecting sunlight in its watery embrace.

The scent of pine and earth, a calming blend,
Where worries fade and spirits find their ease,
In nature's arms, a solace without end,
A sanctuary where hearts can truly seize.

Golden rays descend, painting the sky,
Nature's masterpiece, before we say goodbye.
