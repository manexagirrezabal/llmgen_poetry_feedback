A plastic tide, a papery wave,
Where cans and bottles in silence rave.
Food scraps decay, a pungent stew,
Forgotten treasures, lost to view.

The stench hangs heavy, a choking haze,
As nature weeps for forgotten days.
A symphony of rustling, crunching sound,
Where creatures scavenge on barren ground.

This mountain of refuse, a somber sight,
A testament to our wasteful plight.
Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this wasteland into a vibrant state. 
With mindful hands and hearts that care,
