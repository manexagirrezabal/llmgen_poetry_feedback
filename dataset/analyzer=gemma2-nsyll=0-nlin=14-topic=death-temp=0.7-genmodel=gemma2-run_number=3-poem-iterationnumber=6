The twilight falls, a soft and somber hue,
As day surrenders to the night's embrace anew.
A final heartbeat falters, slows its pace,
And life's grand journey finds its resting place.

No more the warmth of touch, no voice to hear,
Just silent echoes whispered in our tear.
Yet love remains, a beacon in the dark,
Guiding lost souls toward a distant spark.

Though grief may linger, holding us so tight,
Remember joy's sweet echo in the fading light. 
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A journey homeward to a loving heart.
