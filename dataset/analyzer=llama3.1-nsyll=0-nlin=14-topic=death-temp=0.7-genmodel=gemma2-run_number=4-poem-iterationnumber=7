A whisper soft, a breath that fades away,
Life's vibrant dance concludes its final sway.
The tapestry of time unfurled and laid to rest,
As souls embark on journeys, truly blessed.

Through veils of night, they wander, free and bright,
To realms unknown, where stars ignite their light.
Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's tender echo whispers hope again.

In memories held dear, our loved ones reside,
Forever etched within our hearts' deep tide.
Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever glean. 
No longer bound by earthly chains we see.
