 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As life's last breath slips into the sky

The heart that beats, now still and cold
 Memories of love, forever to hold
In darkness lies, a peaceful rest
Eternal sleep, for the soul's unrest
 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 8 lines, it has 4 lines. Can you create a poem with 8 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.

In darkness lies, a peaceful rest
Eternal sleep, for the soul's unrest
 > human: Thank you!
