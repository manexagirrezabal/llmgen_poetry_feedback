 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The breath that filled your chest now stills,
A silent pause, a final thrill.
The eyes that held the world's bright gaze,
Now dimmed and closed in twilight haze.
No more the laughter, touch, or tears,
Only the echo of passing years,
And memories whispered on the breeze. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š Is there anything else I can help you with?
