 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Where paper boats forever ride.
Glass shards gleam, a broken dream,
And food scraps rot, a putrid stream.
The earth groans under weight untold,
A silent story, dark and cold.
Will we learn to mend this waste? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
