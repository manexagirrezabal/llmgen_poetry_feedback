 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes in the morning dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life once bright, now fading, growing cold.
But memories linger, like embers in the night,
Guiding stars that pierce the endless blight.

Though bodies slumber, spirits take their flight,
To realms unknown, bathed in ethereal light.
And though we grieve, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's gentle touch will ease the mournful strain.

For death is not an ending, but a start,
A passage through the veil, to mend a broken heart. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, extinguished in our hearts.
No more the touch, the laughter, or the smile,
Just empty space where life once walked a while.

A tapestry unwoven, threads now frayed,
A silent song, forever unafraid.
But memories bloom like flowers in the sun,
Their fragrance lingers, though the journey's done.

The soul takes flight on wings unseen and free,
To realms of peace, where shadows cannot be.
And though we mourn, and tears may freely fall,
Love's gentle hand will guide us through it all.

For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms beyond our earthly shore. 




 > human: Thank you!
