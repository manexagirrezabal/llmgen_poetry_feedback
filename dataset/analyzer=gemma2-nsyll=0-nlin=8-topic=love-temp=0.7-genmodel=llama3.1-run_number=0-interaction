 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Soft whispers in the dead of night
A gentle touch that sets my soul alight
Love's flame burns bright and true and free
Melting fears and doubts in ecstasy

In your eyes, my heart finds a home
With you, I am never far from love's sweet tone
Together we'll dance beneath the starry sky
Forever entwined, our hearts beating high
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I hope you enjoy the poem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
