 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Their gentle sway a peaceful sight.

The river flows with waters clear,
Reflecting beauty, calming fear.
The mountains rise with ancient might,
A testament to nature's endless light.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that you enjoyed. If you'd like another one or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
