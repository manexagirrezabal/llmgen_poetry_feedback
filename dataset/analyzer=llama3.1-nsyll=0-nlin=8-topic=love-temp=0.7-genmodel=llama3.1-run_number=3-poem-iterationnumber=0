Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can never fade,
A connection that's made with every glance displayed.

In its arms we find our peaceful nest,
Where worries cease and love finds rest.
With every beat, it grows more true,
Forever a bond between me and you.
