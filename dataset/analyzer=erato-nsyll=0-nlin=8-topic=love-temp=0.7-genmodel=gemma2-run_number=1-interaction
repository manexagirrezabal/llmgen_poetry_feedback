 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
Emotions bloom, forever stirred.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's unwavering embrace enthralls.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true,
Forever bound, me and you. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š
