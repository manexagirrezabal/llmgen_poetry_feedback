A box of wires, a silent guide,
The router hums, a digital tide.
Connecting worlds, unseen and vast,
From homes to servers, holding fast.

Packets fly, a fleeting dance,
Through ethernet trails, a vibrant trance.
Wi-Fi whispers, signals spread,
Across the airwaves, stories are read.

A gateway built of silicon heart,
Sharing knowledge, playing its part.
Streaming movies, calls that chime,
Connecting lives, transcending time.

The router's pulse, a steady beat,
Keeping us linked, from head to feet.
