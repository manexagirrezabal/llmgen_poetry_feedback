A crimson sunset paints the evening sky,
With hues of orange, purple, and gold on high.
Clouds like brushstrokes, scattered far and wide,
Reflecting beauty, where dreams reside.

The air grows cooler, as twilight takes its hold,
Stars begin to glimmer, stories yet untold.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of autumn, a tranquil scene.

Fireflies flicker, tiny sparks of light,
Guiding lost souls through the darkening night.
Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
As nature slumbers, secrets it will keep.
