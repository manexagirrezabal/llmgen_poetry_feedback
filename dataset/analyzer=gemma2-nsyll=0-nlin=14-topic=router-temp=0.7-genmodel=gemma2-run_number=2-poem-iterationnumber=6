A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
It weaves a web where data flows asleep.
Packets dance through wires, swift and unseen,
Connecting worlds, both distant and between.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It grants us access, at our command.
A silent guardian, ever watching near,
Ensuring signals travel clear and dear.

The router stands, a sentinel of light,
Guiding information through the digital night. 
No longer bound by distance, we can roam,
Thanks to its hum, bringing us back home.
