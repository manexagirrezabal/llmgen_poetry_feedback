A plastic tide, a metal sea of waste,
Where dreams are buried, hopes forever lost.
Forgotten wrappers, cardboard's brittle taste,
A silent graveyard, at what terrible cost?

The stench of rot, a symphony of decay,
As creatures scurry through the broken glass.
We built our empires on this fragile clay,
And left behind a legacy that will not pass.

Can we not learn, can we not turn around?
To mend the Earth, before it's all in vain?
Let us reclaim what we have cast to ground,
And build a future free from endless pain.

A cleaner world, where trash finds its true place,
A brighter dawn, with hope and love's embrace.
