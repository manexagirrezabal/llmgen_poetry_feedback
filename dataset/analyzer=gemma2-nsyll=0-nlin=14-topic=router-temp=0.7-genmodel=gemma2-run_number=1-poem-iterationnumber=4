A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
Connecting worlds where secrets safely sleep.
Through wires spun, a digital tide does flow,
Sharing stories, knowledge, to and fro.

From distant lands to screens that brightly gleam,
The router whispers, fulfilling every dream.
It bridges gaps, transcends the earthly plane,
A silent guardian, easing life's refrain.

With every click, with every scrolling scroll,
It guides our journey, reaching for a goal.
So let us praise this marvel, small and bright,
The router's magic, keeping worlds alight.
