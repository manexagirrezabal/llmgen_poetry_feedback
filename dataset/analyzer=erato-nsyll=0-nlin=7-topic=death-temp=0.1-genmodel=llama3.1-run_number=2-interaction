 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand
He takes the breath from mortal land
And in his wake, a void is made
Where love and laughter once were displayed
Eternal rest, in endless night.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or have any other requests, feel free to ask!
