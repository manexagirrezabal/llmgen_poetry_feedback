 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams once soared, now trash sets free.
Bottles and boxes, a tangled mess,
Forgotten desires, put to the test.
Landfills grow wider, a silent despair,
Our careless consumption, a burden we bear.
Will future generations inherit this snare? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
