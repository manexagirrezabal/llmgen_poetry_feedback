The twilight whispers, painting skies in gold,
As day surrenders to the night's embrace.
A gentle breeze, a story yet untold,
Rustles through leaves with quiet grace.

The sun descends, a fiery, fading gleam,
Casting long shadows on the waiting earth.
Stars begin to shimmer, like a dream,
And silence falls, a sacred, gentle birth.

A lone owl calls, a haunting melody,
As crickets chirp their lullaby so sweet.
The world around us rests in reverie,
Beneath the moon's soft, silvery heat.

So let us pause, and breathe the tranquil air,
And find solace in this moment, calm and fair.
