 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A sea of waste, for me and you.

The stench is strong, a foul smell,
As rotting food begins to tell.
The earth cries out in dismay,
As we discard, day by day.

Our actions have a price to pay,
For the future's health, we must sway.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, it's true,
But still we throw, with little to do.

The consequences of our waste abound,
A world in peril, all around.
