A whispered word, a glance across the room,
Ignites a spark, dispelling all the gloom.
Two hearts that beat as one, a symphony,
Of love unspoken, yet so clearly seen.

A gentle touch, a hand held tight and warm,
Protecting from the world, safe from the storm.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Stars above them, shining ever bright.

Through changing seasons, love will always bloom,
A constant beacon, dispelling all the gloom.
Two souls entwined, forever side by side,
In love's embrace, their destinies reside. 
Their love a story, beautifully told.
