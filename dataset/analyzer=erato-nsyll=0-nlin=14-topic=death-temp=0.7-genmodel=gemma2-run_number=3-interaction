 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a fading light,
The veil descends, obscuring sight.
A final breath, a silent plea,
To linger still, to simply be.

But shadows dance and memories fade,
As life's bright tapestry is laid
Upon the altar of the unknown,
Where seeds of sorrow are sown.

Yet in this hush, a peace descends,
A journey ends, a story blends
With countless others, lost and found,
Within the silence, profound.

And though we grieve, with hearts so sore,
Life's eternal dance will evermore. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
