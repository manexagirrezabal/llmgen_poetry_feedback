The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks reaching high into the light.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its serene theme.

The forest floor, a carpet deep and green,
A haven for creatures, wild and unseen.
The birds sing sweetly, their melodies blend,
In harmony with nature's gentle trend.

As day gives way to night's dark shade,
Nature's beauty is forever displayed,
Peace descends upon the land slowly.
