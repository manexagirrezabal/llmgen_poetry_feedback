The willow weeps by water's gentle flow,
Its branches sway in whispers soft and low.
A lone bird sings, perched on fragile bough,
As twilight paints the sky in shades of glow.

The sun descends, a fiery ball of red,
Kissing the hills with hues of gold and rose.
A gentle breeze carries secrets unsaid,
Amongst the rustling leaves where silence grows.

Stars begin to twinkle, one by one,
Across the canvas of the deepening night. 
The world is hushed, its day's work nearly done,
And dreams take flight in pale, ethereal light.
