The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustling, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where the wildflowers grow.

A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
Its voice a thread that weaves through autumn air.
Crimson clouds drift by, a gentle fleet,
As twilight's embrace begins to share.

The world slows down, a peaceful reverie,
Where time itself seems lost in golden light.
And in this stillness, I am finally free,
To breathe and dream beneath the fading night.

A tapestry of beauty, rich and deep,
Before winter's slumber lulls us to sleep.
