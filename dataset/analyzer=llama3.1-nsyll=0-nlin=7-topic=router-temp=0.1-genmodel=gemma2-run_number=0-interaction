 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with digital sheen.
Packets flow through its intricate maze,
Guiding data in a wireless haze.
From distant servers to your eager screen,
The router weaves a web, serene and keen.
A modern marvel, keeping us all connected. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
