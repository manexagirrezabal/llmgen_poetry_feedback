 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A worn and weathered leather case,
Carries secrets with a careful pace.
It holds the tools of daily strife,
And papers that detail a life.
The handle creaks with every stride,
As it carries weight on its side.
In meetings and deals, it takes part,
A trusted ally for the business heart.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
