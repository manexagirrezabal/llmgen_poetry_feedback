 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love's gentle flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It chases fears and brings us near,
Filling our souls with joy and cheer.
In love's sweet touch, we find our home,
A place where hearts are safe to roam.
And there, in love, we are never alone.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that captures the essence of love for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
