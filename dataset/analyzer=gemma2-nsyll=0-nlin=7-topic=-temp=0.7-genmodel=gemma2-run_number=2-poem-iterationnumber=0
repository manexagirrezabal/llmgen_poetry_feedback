The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight dances on waters, stories untold.
A lone bird sings, a melody so sweet,
Nature's symphony, a rhythmic heartbeat.
Clouds drift by like dreams, ethereal and white,
Painting the canvas of day with gentle light.
Peace descends, a moment held so dear.
