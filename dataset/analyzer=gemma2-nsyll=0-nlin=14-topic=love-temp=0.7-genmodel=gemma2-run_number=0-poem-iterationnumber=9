A whispered word, a touch that sets aflame,
Two hearts entwined, in love's eternal game.
A symphony of souls, a melody so sweet,
In love's soft embrace, our destinies we meet.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tender guidance conquers one and all.
A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust we keep,
Forever bound in dreams, while shadows sleep.

With every glance, a story starts to bloom,
Two souls united, dispelling all the gloom.
In love's sweet haven, hearts find solace true,
A timeless journey, me and you. 
Let love forever guide our way, anew.
