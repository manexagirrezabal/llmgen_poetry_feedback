In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with calculated might
The internet's flow, through day and night

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
Connecting devices, in a digital game
Its firmware updated, to keep pace with time
A humble hero, in the digital prime
