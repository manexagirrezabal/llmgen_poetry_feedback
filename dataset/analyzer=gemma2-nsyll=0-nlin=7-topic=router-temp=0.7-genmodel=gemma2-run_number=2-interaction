 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router stands, a network's thrall.
Packets fly through its wired veins,
Connecting worlds, erasing plains
Of distance vast, with digital grace,
A symphony of bits in time and space.
The web unfolds, at its command. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

I hope you enjoyed the poem. Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
