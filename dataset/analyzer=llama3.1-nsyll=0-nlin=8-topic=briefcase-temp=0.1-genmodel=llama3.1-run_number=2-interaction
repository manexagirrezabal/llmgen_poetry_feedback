 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A briefcase sits upon my floor
Filled with papers and documents galore
Its leather worn, its seams now tight
A symbol of work, day and night

It holds my secrets, my plans, my fears
The weight of responsibility it bears
Through meetings and deals, it's by my side
A trusted companion, never to subside
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
