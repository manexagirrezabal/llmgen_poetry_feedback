 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of success in leather so fine,
The briefcase holds secrets, and stories divine.
With clasps that snap shut, and zippers that glide,
It carries the weight of a professional's pride.

Inside its compartments, papers are neatly stacked,
Reports and proposals, with each page carefully packed.
A mobile office on wheels, it travels by one's side,
A trusted companion, through meetings and deadlines to abide.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
