 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Death's silent whisper comes to stay.
It gathers souls with gentle hand,
And takes them to a mystic land.

With every breath, it draws an end,
And in its wake, new life does bend.
The final farewell, a solemn sigh,
A passage through, into the unknown sky.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
