A briefcase sits upon the floor
Its leather worn, its contents in store
It holds the weight of daily strife
And papers that demand attention rife

The zipper creaks with every turn
As keys and pens within it burn
The handle worn, a map to show
The journeys taken, long ago

A symbol of success, some may say
But often empty, at end of day
It sits alone, in silence deep
Awaiting morning's wakeful creep

Its story told, in every crease
And scratches that its owner sees
