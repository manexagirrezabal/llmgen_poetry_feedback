A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, secrets reside,
Deals struck, dreams both far and wide.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
It follows footsteps, for success' sake.
A silent witness, ever near,
The briefcase whispers, "Let's make it clear."
