 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans we hope to find.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that have been bought,
And futures built on promises embraced.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks the path of progress, day by day.
A symbol of ambition, hard-earned feats,
A constant companion on life's winding way.

So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase, where our stories never end. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
