The forest whispers secrets deep,
Of ancient trees that silently sleep.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle breeze,
That stirs the flowers in wild ease.

The sun shines bright, with rays so bold,
Bringing life to all, young and old.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Through valleys green, where wild things beam.

The mountains rise, with peaks so high,
Where eagles soar, against the open sky.
The trees sway free, in wind's gentle hand,
Their branches dancing, in a peaceful land.

In nature's beauty, we find our peace,
And a sense of calm that will never cease.
