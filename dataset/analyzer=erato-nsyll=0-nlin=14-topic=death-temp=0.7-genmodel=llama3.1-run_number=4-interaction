 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness lies a silent guest,
Death's presence felt by all at best.
A whispered farewell, a final sigh,
The end of life, a mournful cry.

With every breath, we draw near,
To the cold wind that chills and brings fear.
No escape from its eternal grasp,
Our time on earth, a fleeting clasp.

In death's dark veil, our souls take flight,
And leave behind the light of life.
 Memories remain, a bittersweet refrain,
A longing for what cannot be regained.

Yet in death's shadow, we find peace too,
A release from pain, a world anew.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I hope you enjoy the poem. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
