 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets the soul free,
A whispered promise of forever to be.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In each other's arms, we'll find our home.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together facing life, beneath the golden sun.

Love is a choice, a decision made with heart,
To cherish and adore, to never depart.
It's a bond that strengthens with each passing day,
A love so strong, it chases all fear away.

In your eyes, my heart finds its home,
With you, I am complete, forever to roam.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you about love. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
