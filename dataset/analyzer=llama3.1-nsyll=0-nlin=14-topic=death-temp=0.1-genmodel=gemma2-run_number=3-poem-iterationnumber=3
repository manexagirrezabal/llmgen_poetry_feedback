The final breath, a whispered sigh takes flight,
A silent curtain falls upon the light.
No more the laughter, joy, or sorrow's plea,
Just empty echoes where life used to be.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ends, a soul forever blessed.
But memories remain, like stars above,
To guide us through the darkness, and with love.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud our sight,
Hope's gentle beacon shines throughout the night.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A passage to a realm beyond our art. 
And there we'll meet again, on fields of gold,
