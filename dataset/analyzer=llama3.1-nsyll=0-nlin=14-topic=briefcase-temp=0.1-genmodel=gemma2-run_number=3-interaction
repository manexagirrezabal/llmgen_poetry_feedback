 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions rise and drown,
In spreadsheets, contracts, plans we hope to find.

A silent witness to boardroom battles fought,
To whispered deals and secrets shared in haste.
It carries burdens, hopes that can be bought,
And futures built on promises embraced.

From office towers to bustling city streets,
It walks the path of progress, day by day.
A symbol of ambition, goals we meet,
Or chase with fervor, come what may.

So raise a glass to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase, where our lives and stories blend.
