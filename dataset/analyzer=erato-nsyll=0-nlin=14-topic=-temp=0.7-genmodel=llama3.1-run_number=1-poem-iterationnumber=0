Silent clouds drift by at night
Their shadows dance upon the wall
A lonely hooting owl takes flight
As darkness falls, and stars stand tall

The world is hushed in quiet sleep
Dreams of distant places creep
Into the mind, like whispers low
Where memories of love do grow

In moonlit gardens, flowers sway
To secrets whispered through the day
Their beauty beckons, pure and bright
A fleeting glimpse, a wistful sight

The night's dark veil, a mystery holds
A world of wonder, yet untold
