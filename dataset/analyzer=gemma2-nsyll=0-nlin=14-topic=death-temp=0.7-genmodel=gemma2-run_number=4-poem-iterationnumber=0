A silent shroud upon the weary eyes,
A final breath, a whisper in the night.
The sun descends, and darkness gently lies
Across the face that once held burning light.

No more the laughter, music, or the dance,
Only the stillness of eternal sleep.
A fading memory, a fleeting chance
To hold a hand, a secret to keep.

But though the body rests in earthly clay,
The spirit soars on wings unseen and free.
And love remains, a beacon in the gray,
A guiding star for all eternity.

So let us grieve, yet find solace in this truth:
That life transcends the boundaries of youth.
