 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm golden ray,
No laughter echoes through the day.
Just quiet shadows, soft and deep,
Where memories gently sleep,
And souls embark on journeys new. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
