A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
In gentle whispers, secrets shared,
Love's tender touch, beyond compare.

A symphony of souls that dance,
A timeless bond, a fleeting glance.
Through laughter bright and shadows deep,
Love's guiding light, our secrets keep.

With every beat, a whispered vow,
Forever bound, here and now.
A tapestry woven, thread by thread,
In love's embrace, we find our bed.

A sanctuary built on trust so true,
Love's gentle hand, will see us through.
