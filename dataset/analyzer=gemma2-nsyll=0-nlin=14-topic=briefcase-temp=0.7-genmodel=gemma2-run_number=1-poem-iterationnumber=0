A square of leather, worn and brown with age,
Holds secrets whispered in boardroom's din.
A symphony of meetings, deals engage,
And fortunes won within its rigid skin.

It sits beside a chair, a silent guard,
Of dreams and plans, ambitions yet untamed.
A weight it carries, both tangible and hard,
The burdens borne by those who've claimed their name.

From coffee shops to towering glass facades,
It marches forth, a symbol of the grind.
Through bustling streets, its presence seldom fades,
A constant fixture in our daily kind.

And though its contents may forever hide,
Its story echoes through the working tide.
