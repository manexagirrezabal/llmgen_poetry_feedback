In silicon halls, it stands so tall,
A router's might, that connects us all.
With wires humming, and lights aglow,
It guides our data, as it flows.

Through fiber optic cables, it makes its way,
To distant servers, in a digital day.
It routes the traffic, with precision fine,
 Ensuring speed, and a connection divine.

In homes and offices, it's a common sight,
A box of wonder, that keeps us online tonight.
With Wi-Fi signals, it broadcasts far and wide,
Connecting devices, side by side.

Its work is vital, in this digital age,
Keeping us connected, in a world engaged.
