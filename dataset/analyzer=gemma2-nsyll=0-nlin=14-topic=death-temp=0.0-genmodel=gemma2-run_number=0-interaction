 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes where life once infused.

A gentle slumber, a release from pain,
A journey onward, beyond earthly reign.
The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories linger, secrets they will keep.

Though darkness claims us, love's light shines above,
A guiding star that whispers tales of love.
And in the tapestry of time, our threads entwined,
With every soul who's left this earthly bind.

So fear not death, its embrace is kind,
A passage to a peace we hope to find. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the pulse that beat a steady drum,
Just silence reigns, where life had overcome.

A tapestry of moments, woven tight,
Now fades to gray, in fading candlelight.
But love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls through shadows, dark and bright.

Though flesh decays, and bones return to dust,
The spirit soars, on wings of hope and trust.
A journey starts, beyond the veil unseen,
Where stars ignite, and dreams forever glean.

And though we grieve, for those who've passed away,
Their memory lives, in hearts that love will stay.
