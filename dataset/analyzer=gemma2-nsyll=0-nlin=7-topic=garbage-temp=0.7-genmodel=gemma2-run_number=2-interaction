 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic cup, a cardboard box,
A metal can, a crumpled socks.
Discarded dreams and broken toys,
A mountain grows, a landfill noise.
The earth sighs deep, a heavy weight,
As nature cries, "This is our fate."
Will we learn, or will we wait? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️  </span>
