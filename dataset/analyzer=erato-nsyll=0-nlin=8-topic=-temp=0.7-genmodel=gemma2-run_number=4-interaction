 > assistant: The moon, a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Casts shadows long and whispers secrets low.
Stars like diamonds scattered, ablaze and terse,
Across a canvas painted black with glow.

A gentle breeze caresses leaves so green,
And crickets chirp a lullaby of peace.
A silent world, where dreams begin unseen,
And weary souls find solace and release. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š   Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
