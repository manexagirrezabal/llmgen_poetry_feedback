 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The veil of night descends, a silent shroud,
Where shadows dance and whispers softly speak.
A final breath escapes, a whispered vow,
As life's bright tapestry begins to leak.

No longer bound by flesh and mortal pain,
The soul takes flight on wings unseen, unknown.
To realms beyond the reach of sun and rain,
Where seeds of memory are gently sown.

Though grief may linger, heavy in the heart,
Let love's embrace bring solace and release.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A journey to a realm of endless peace.

So sleep now soundly, free from earthly strife,
And dream your dreams beneath the stars aloft. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A hush descends, the world grows still and cold,
The beating heart, a rhythm hushed and gone.
No longer stories whispered, brave and bold,
Just empty silence where laughter once had dawn.

But is it truly ending, or a start?
A passage through the veil to realms unseen?
Where whispers dance and shadows play their part,
And memories bloom, forever evergreen.

Though tears may fall, and sorrow grip the soul,
Love's gentle echo lingers in the air.
A whispered promise, making spirits whole,
That life endures beyond this earthly snare.

So sleep now peaceful, journey to the light,
Where stars ignite and darkness turns to bright. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š   Let me know if I can help create anything else for you.
