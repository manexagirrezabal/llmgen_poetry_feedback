Silent stars shine bright in the night
A celestial show, beyond our sight
Their gentle twinkle, a lullaby sweet
As the world below, its worries would meet

The moon, a glowing orb of white
Lends magic to, this peaceful sight
The trees, they sway, in a gentle breeze
Their leaves rustling soft, with a soothing ease

In this serene scene, all troubles fade
As nature's beauty, our spirits has made
Free from the weight, of life's cares and strife
We breathe in calm, and let out a sigh of relief

And as we gaze, at this peaceful sight
Our hearts are filled, with a sense of delight.
