A plastic sea of wrappers, bags, and tins,
A symphony of scents both foul and sweet,
Where broken toys and wilting flowers spin
In swirling eddies, a forgotten treat.
The stench of rot, a chorus grimly sung,
By maggots feasting on decay's embrace.
A monument to waste, where dreams have flung
Themselves upon this desolate disgrace.
But even here, amidst the muck and mire,
A fragile sprout may pierce the hardened ground.
Hope whispers soft, a flickering desire,
That from this ruin, beauty can be found.
So let us mend our ways, with hearts anew,
And turn this tide of trash to something true.
