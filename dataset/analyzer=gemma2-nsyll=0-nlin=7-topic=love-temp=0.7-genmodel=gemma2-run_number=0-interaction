 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a gentle touch,
A spark ignites, loved oh so much.
Two souls entwined, a beating heart,
A symphony of feelings start.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
Love's tapestry, encompassing all.
Forever bound, in dreams we soar. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
