In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
Connecting devices, in a digital line

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its might
A beacon of access, through day and night
It manages traffic, with a steady hand
Keeping the network, in perfect stand
