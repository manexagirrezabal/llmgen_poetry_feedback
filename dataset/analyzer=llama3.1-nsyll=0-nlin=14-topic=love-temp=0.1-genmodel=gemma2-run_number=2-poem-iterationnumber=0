A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so sweet,
A symphony of hearts, a rhythmic beat.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tapestry unfolds, embracing all.
A sanctuary found in each other's eyes,
Where trust resides and hope forever flies.

With every passing day, the love grows strong,
A melody that plays, a timeless song.
Two lives united, destinies aligned,
In love's embrace, true happiness we find.
