 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food scraps rot, a stinky mess,
Polluting air, a great distress.

In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
But toxins seep, a poisonous sight.
The ocean's waves, a garbage sea,
A reflection of humanity.

We must change our ways, it's time to see,
The harm we cause, and set it free.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
