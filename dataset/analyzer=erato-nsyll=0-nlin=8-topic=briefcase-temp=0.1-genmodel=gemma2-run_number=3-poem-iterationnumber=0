A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, secrets reside,
Deals struck, dreams both far and wide.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
The briefcase journeys, for fortune's stakes.
A silent witness, it bears the weight,
Of triumphs won and futures fate.
