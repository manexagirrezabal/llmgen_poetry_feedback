 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with speed so fine
A silent guardian, always on its mind
The router's power, a wondrous thing to see
 Connecting devices, for you and me
Keeping our networks, strong and free
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
