Sunlight streams through leaves of emerald green,
A gentle breeze caresses fields of gold,
Where wildflowers bloom, a vibrant scene,
And stories whispered by the wind unfold.

A babbling brook sings its tranquil tune,
As silver fish dart 'neath the willow's sway,
The air is sweet with summer's afternoon,
And birdsong fills the forest's gentle way.

Clouds drift like dreams across a canvas blue,
While butterflies on painted wings take flight,
Nature's beauty, forever fresh and new,
A symphony of colors, pure delight.

In this embrace, our worries fade away,
And peace descends upon a perfect day.
