 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it sits unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a symphony of light,
Connecting worlds both day and night.

From laptop screens to phones in hand,
It weaves a path across the land.
Packets fly, a constant stream,
Sharing stories, laughter, and a gleam.

A gateway to knowledge, vast and wide,
Where information flows with boundless stride.
But when it falters, connections break,
And digital silence fills the wake.

So praise the router, humble and bold,
For keeping us connected, young and old. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!  âœ¨
