 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents, one and all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
It's a symbol of success, or so it seems,
A tool for professionals, in constant dreams.
In meetings and deals, it holds its might.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
