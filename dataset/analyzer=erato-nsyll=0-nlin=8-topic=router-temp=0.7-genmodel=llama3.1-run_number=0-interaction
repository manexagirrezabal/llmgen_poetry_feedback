 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In the corner, it sits so tall,
Routing signals to one and all.
Its glowing lights shine bright with might,
As data flows through day and night.

With Wi-Fi waves that dance and play,
It connects us in a digital way.
A humble hero of the modern age,
Keeping our devices connected in its stage.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about routers for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
