 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance and weave through its domain,
A digital highway, easing every strain.
From distant shores to screens held close at hand,
It bridges gaps, a network's guiding strand.
The router hums, a tireless, steady beat,
Ensuring flow, where knowledge can compete. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
