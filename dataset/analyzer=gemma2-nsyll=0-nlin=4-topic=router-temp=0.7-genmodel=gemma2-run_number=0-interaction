 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent hum, a blinking light,
Connecting worlds both day and night.
Data streams through its unseen might,
The router guides with all its sight. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ğŸ˜Š  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?  ğŸ’«
