In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with precision so fine
The internet's pathways, in a digital design

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its might
Connecting devices, day and endless night
Its processor humming, as data flows free
A behind-the-scenes hero, for you and me
