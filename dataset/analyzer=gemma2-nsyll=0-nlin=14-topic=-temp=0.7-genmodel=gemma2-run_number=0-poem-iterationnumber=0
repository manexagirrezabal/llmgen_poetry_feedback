The sun dips low, a brushstroke on the sky,
Painting hues of orange, red, and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers secrets nigh,
As leaves dance freely, stories to be told.

Shadows lengthen, stretching out their arms,
Embracing twilight's quiet, peaceful grace.
The world slows down, escaping daily harms,
And finds solace in this tranquil space.

Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
A million diamonds scattered overhead.
The moon ascends, her silver journey spun,
Guiding lost souls with a gentle thread.

Night descends, a velvet cloak so deep,
Inviting dreams and slumber's sweet release.
