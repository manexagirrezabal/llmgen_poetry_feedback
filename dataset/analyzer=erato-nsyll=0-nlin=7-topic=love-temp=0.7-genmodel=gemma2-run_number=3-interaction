 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
Laughter shared, and tears that fall,
Through sunshine bright, or winter's thrall.
A gentle touch, a whispered word,
Love's tender promise, forever heard.
A bond unbreakable, strong and true.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
