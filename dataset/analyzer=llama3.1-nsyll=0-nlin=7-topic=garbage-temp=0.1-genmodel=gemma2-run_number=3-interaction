 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded carelessly.
Tin cans and bottles, a tangled mess,
Forgotten treasures, put to the test.
Nature cries out, choked by our waste,
A silent plea, a desperate haste.
Will we learn to cherish, before it's too late? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
