 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep,
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep.
The forest whispers secrets to the trees,
A gentle breeze rustles through the summer's ease.
Fireflies flicker like tiny lanterns bright,
Stars up above shine with a soft, celestial light.
In this peaceful night, all worries cease.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you. If you'd like another one or need anything else, feel free to ask!
