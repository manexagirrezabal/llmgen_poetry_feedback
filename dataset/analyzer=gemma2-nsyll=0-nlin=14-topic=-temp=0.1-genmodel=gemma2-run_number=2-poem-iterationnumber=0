The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, stories untold.
Sunlight paints shadows, long and serene,
As autumn's embrace turns the world evergreen.

Crimson and amber, a vibrant display,
Nature's masterpiece, fading with each day.
Squirrels gather treasures, winter's approach,
While geese in formation southward encroach.

A chill in the air, a hint of frost's kiss,
Memories linger, moments we miss.
But beauty persists, in every falling leaf,
A reminder that change brings solace and grief.

So let us embrace this season's soft grace,
And find peace within nature's warm space.
