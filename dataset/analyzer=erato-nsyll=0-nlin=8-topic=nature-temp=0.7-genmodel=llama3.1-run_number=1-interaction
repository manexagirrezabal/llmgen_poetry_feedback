 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so green,
A gentle breeze rustles through their scene.

The forest floor is soft and deep,
Where wildflowers bloom in secret sleep.
The river flows with a soothing sound,
As nature's beauty all around.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create something for you to enjoy. If you want more poetry, just let me know!
