 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming our hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes our souls unfold.

With every kiss, our love will grow,
In each other's eyes, our hearts will glow.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
Together facing life, beneath the sun.

Love is a journey that we take with care,
A path that winds through joy and sorrow's snare.
But in each other's arms, we find our way,
And with every step, our love will stay.

In love's sweet garden, we'll forever bloom,
Our hearts entwined, our love will be the room.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that resonated with you. If you have any other requests or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
