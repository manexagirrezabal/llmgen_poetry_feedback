Whispers of wind through trees so tall,
Dance with leaves that rustle and fall.
Summer's warmth gives way to autumn's sigh,
As nature's palette paints the evening sky.

Golden hues and crimson shades unfold,
A fleeting beauty that our souls are told.
The forest floor, a carpet soft and deep,
Invites us in to secrets it does keep.

 Memories of laughter echo through the air,
As sunbeams filter, casting shadows rare.
The scent of woodsmoke wafts on gentle breeze,
Reminding us of cozy winter's ease.

In this serene and peaceful evening light,
We find solace from life's busy fight.
