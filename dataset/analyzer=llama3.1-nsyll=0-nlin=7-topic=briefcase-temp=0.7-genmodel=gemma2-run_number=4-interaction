 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, sleek and bold,
Holds secrets stories yet untold.
From boardroom battles to streetlight strolls,
It carries dreams, it takes control.
With every click, a silent plea,
For success, for victory, to be.
A briefcase waits, ready to roam. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š 

Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  I'm always up for a challenge!
