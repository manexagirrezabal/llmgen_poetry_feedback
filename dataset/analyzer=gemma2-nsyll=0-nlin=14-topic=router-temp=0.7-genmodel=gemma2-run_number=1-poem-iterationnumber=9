A humble box, unassuming in its place,
The router hums, with tireless, steady grace.
Through wires spun, a digital tide does flow,
Connecting lives, both high and low.

From distant lands to screens that softly glow,
It sends our thoughts, wherever they may go.
A silent guardian, ever watchful, true,
Guiding connections, old and fresh and new.

With every click, a world unfolds its grace,
In shared connection, smiles light up the space.
So let us praise this hero, small and bright,
The router's magic, keeping worlds alight.
