 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop chats,
It's a constant companion, ever near.
Through bustling streets and crowded city spats,
It carries burdens, banishing all fear.

A symbol of success, or maybe just,
The daily grind that keeps us on our feet.
But in its clasp, a story can be thrust,
Of triumphs won, and bitter defeats.

So raise a glass to this humble case,
A silent witness to life's hurried pace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
