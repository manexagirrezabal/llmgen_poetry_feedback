 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A humble hero of the digital age,
The router connects us to a virtual stage.
With wires and Wi-Fi, it bridges far and wide,
Linking devices in a seamless tide.

Its processor humming, it directs the flow,
Of data packets that never seem to slow.
In unseen ways, it keeps our connections strong,
A silent sentinel of the digital throng.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
