A sturdy frame of leather, dark and deep,
The briefcase whispers secrets while we sleep.
It holds ambitions, hopes that soar and fall,
And dreams pursued beyond life's shadowed wall.

Inside its depths, a universe unseen,
Of plans and schemes, where futures intervene.
From bustling streets to hushed boardroom halls,
It carries burdens, answering duty's calls.

A silent witness to the human race,
Its metal clasps hold time within their space.
A symbol etched in strength, both bold and true,
The briefcase journeys with us, me and you.
