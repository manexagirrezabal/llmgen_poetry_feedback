A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

With every beat, their love begins to soar,
A symphony of passion, evermore.
No words can capture, no song can truly say,
The depth of feeling, that lights up every day.

In love's embrace, they find their destiny,
Two souls as one, eternally.
