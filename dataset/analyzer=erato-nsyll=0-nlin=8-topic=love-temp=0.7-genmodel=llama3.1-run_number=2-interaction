 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets the soul free,
A feeling that's pure and meant to be.

With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
In love's sweet refuge, we've found a home.
Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
Forever and always, it will forever rest.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
