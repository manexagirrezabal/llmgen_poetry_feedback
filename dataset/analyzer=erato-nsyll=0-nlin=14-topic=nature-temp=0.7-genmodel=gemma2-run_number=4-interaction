 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through emerald leaves,
Sunbeams dance on petals, soft and bright.
A babbling brook sings melodies that weave
Through fields of wildflowers, bathed in golden light.

Tall trees stand guard, their branches reaching high,
Towards the azure canvas of the sky.
Clouds drift like dreams, serene and slow they fly,
While birdsong fills the air with sweet reply.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Awakens senses, calms the restless mind.
In nature's embrace, true solace we can find,
A sanctuary where peace and joy transcend. 

So let us wander, lose ourselves in green,
And feel the magic that this world has seen. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. 🌻
