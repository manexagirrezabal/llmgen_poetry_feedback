A mountain of refuse, a sight to behold,
Plastic and paper, stories untold.
Food scraps and wrappers, remnants of feasts,
Tarnished treasures, forgotten at least.

A symphony of odors, both foul and grand,
Nature recoils, from this man-made land.
But within the chaos, life finds its way,
Recycling hope, for a brighter day.
