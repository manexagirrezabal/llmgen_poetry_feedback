 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers through the night
A gentle breeze that stirs the light
Stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial display to know

Dreams unfolding, secrets deep
The darkness reigns, yet beauty shines
In this still hour, peaceful signs.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
