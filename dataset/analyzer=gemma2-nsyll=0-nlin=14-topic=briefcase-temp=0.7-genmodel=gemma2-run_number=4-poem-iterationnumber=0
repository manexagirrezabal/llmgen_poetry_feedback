A shell of leather, sturdy and sleek,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams unique.
Inside it sleeps ambition's fire,
And plans for triumph, rising higher.

It bears the weight of countless hours,
Of meetings held in bustling towers.
Deals forged in whispers, contracts signed,
A silent witness to fate entwined.

From boardroom battles to street-side stands,
It walks with purpose, through shifting sands.
A symbol of progress, a tool refined,
The briefcase holds the world within its bind.

A constant companion, day by day,
Through triumphs won and losses in the fray.
