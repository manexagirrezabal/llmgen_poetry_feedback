 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Death whispers secrets, night by day.
A whispered promise, dark and cold,
A final farewell, young and old.

With silent steps, he comes to claim,
The fleeting life, with all its fame.
No sorrow can the grave impart,
For in its depths, a peaceful heart.

In death's dark veil, we find our rest,
From life's loud din, where love is tested.
Yet still we cling to earthly ties,
And mourn the loss of loved ones' sighs.

But even death cannot hold us tight,
For in its darkness, there's a gentle light.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
