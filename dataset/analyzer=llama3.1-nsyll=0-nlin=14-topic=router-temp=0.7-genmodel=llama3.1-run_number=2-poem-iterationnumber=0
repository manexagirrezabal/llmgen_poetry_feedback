In silicon halls, a device resides
Routing packets with speedy strides
A hub of connection, strong and free
Linking devices, a network's key

With antennas high, it reaches far
Receiving signals from near and star
Its processor hums, a gentle beat
As data flows through its digital street

It prioritizes, allocates with care
Ensuring speed, for those who share
A crucial link, in the digital chain
Keeping pace, with the world's wild gain

In homes and offices, it's always near
Directing traffic, without fear
