A sea of plastic, bottles toss and turn,
Where crumpled cans their silent stories burn.
Forgotten dreams, in paper wrappers yearn,
For better days, a lesson to be learned.

The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
Where nature's balance struggles to hold fast.
Landfills grow, consuming time and space,
A heavy burden on this weary race.

But even here, a resilient sprout appears,
Amidst the refuse, quelling all our fears.
A fragile hope, dispelling doubt and tears,
To mend our ways, and conquer waste's snares.
