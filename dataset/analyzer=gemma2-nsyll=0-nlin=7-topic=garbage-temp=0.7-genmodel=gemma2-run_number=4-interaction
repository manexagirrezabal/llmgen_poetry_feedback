 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea of swirling waste,
Where paper boats no longer float,
And bottles dance in sun's embrace,
A silent symphony of bloat.

Forgotten toys and broken dreams,
Lie buried deep within this heap,
Reflecting all that life disowns.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
