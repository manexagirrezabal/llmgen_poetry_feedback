 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain, drawn at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm, golden ray,
Nor moonlit dance to end the day.
A whispered sigh, a gentle sleep,
Where shadows dance and secrets keep.
The body rests, the soul takes flight,
To realms unknown, beyond the night. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
