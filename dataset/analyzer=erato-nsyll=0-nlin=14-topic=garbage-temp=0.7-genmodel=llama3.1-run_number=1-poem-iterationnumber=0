In streets and alleys, it's scattered wide
A messy landscape, where trash resides
Plastic bags and cans, a sorry sight
The remnants of our daily fight

Food wrappers and bottles, a discarded heap
The byproduct of our consumption deep
We use and we waste, without a care
Leaving behind a trail of garbage there

It chokes the oceans, it clutters the land
A problem so vast, it's hard to withstand
The stench of rotting, the sight of decay
A blight on our planet, every single day

We must do better, before it's too late
For the sake of the earth, we must create
