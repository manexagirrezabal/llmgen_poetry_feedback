A whispered sigh, a breath that fades away,
Life's vibrant dance concludes its final sway.
The tapestry unfurled, now gently laid to rest,
As souls embark on journeys, truly blessed.

Through veils of night, they wander, free and bright,
To realms unknown, bathed in ethereal light.
Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's tender echo whispers hope again.

In memories cherished, spirits find their place,
A timeless bond that death cannot erase.
Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where dreams forever convene. 

No longer bound by earthly chains we see,
