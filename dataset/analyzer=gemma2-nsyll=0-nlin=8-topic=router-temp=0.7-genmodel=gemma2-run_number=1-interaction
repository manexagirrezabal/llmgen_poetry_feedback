 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds through wires and light keen.
Data flows like rivers, swift and strong,
Guiding packets where they belong.
From web to game, a constant hum,
It weaves a tapestry, connections come.
The router's heart, a tireless beat,
Sharing knowledge, making networks complete. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
