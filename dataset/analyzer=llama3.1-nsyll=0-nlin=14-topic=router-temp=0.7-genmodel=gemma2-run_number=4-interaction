 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It speaks in packets, a language unknown,
Connecting worlds, both near and far flown.

The humble router, a modern-day sage,
Directing traffic, turning every page.
From streaming shows to emails sent with care,
It weaves the tapestry, connecting everywhere.

A gateway to knowledge, a portal to fun,
It keeps us linked, until day is done.
Invisible force, yet ever so strong,
Guiding our steps, where we belong.

So thank the router, for its tireless might,
Bringing us closer, in the digital light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you need help with anything else.
