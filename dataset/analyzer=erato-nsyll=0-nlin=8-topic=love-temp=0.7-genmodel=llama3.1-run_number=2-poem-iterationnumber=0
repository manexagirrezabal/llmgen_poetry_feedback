Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets the soul free,
A feeling that's pure and meant to be.

With every kiss, our hearts beat as one,
In love's sweet refuge, we've found a home.
Through laughter and tears, it stands the test,
Forever and always, it will forever rest.
