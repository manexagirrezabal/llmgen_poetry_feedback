A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles gently ride.
Forgotten toys, a broken chair,
The remnants of a life once rare.

A swirling vortex, foul and deep,
Where secrets buried, never sleep.
From kitchen scraps to dusty books,
Our discarded dreams and fleeting looks.

A silent story, told in waste,
Of habits formed, time's swift embrace.
Can we turn this tide of shame?
And weave a future free from blame?
Perhaps one day, the earth will heal.
