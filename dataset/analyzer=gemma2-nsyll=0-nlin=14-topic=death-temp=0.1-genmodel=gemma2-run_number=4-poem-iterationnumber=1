The final breath, a whispered sigh escapes,
A dimming light, where life's bright flame drapes.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just silence reigns, where echoes softly hum.

The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories dance, secrets they will keep.
A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now fades to gray, a design left behind.

But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding souls through darkness, shining bright.
And though we mourn, let hope's sweet solace bloom,
For life transcends this earthly, shadowed room.

In realms unseen, where spirits gently roam,
We find our peace, and make our final home.
