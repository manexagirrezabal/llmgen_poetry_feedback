 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent stars shine in the midnight sky
A gentle breeze stirs, and the trees sigh
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep
Dreams dance on the wind, secrets keep
In this still hour, I find my peace
My heart beats slow, my soul releases
In the darkness, I am free to breathe
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask.
