A rigid shell of leather worn and brown,
It guards ambitions, hopes that rise and drown.
Through bustling crowds and sterile office halls,
It carries burdens, answers duty's calls.

Inside its depths, a universe unfolds,
Of spreadsheets spun and stories yet untold.
Contracts inked, decisions made with haste,
The briefcase holds the weight of time embraced.

A symbol etched in metal, strong and true,
Of dreams pursued, ambitions to pursue.
From boardroom battles to quiet coffee breaks,
It walks beside us, through triumphs and mistakes.
