The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, a story untold.
Sunbeams dance softly on autumn's embrace,
Painting landscapes with hues of time and grace.

Crimson and amber, a fiery delight,
As nature prepares for the coming night.
Squirrels gather acorns, a winter's supply,
While geese honk farewell, soaring in the sky.

The air grows crisp, with a scent of decay,
A poignant reminder that seasons will sway.
Yet beauty persists, in this fleeting display,
A final flourish before winter's cold sway.
So let us cherish these moments so rare,
Before autumn's magic fades into air.
