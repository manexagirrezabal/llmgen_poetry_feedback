 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs them with glee.

The flowers bloom, a colorful sight,
Their sweet perfume fills up the night.
The stars come out, a twinkling show,
Nature's beauty is on full display.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: It was my pleasure to create something for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
