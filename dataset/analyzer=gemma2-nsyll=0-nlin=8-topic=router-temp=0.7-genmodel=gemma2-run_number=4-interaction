 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It hums a tune, connecting one and all.
Packets dance through wires, light and swift,
Across the web, a digital gift.
From distant shores to homes nearby,
It weaves a tapestry, beneath the sky.
The router reigns, a modern-day king,
A gateway to worlds, where knowledge takes wing. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with? ğŸ˜Š
