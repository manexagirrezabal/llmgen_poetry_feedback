 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
As Nature's peaceful beauty calls to me.

The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
Invites my feet to wander and be seen.
The creatures of the wild, they dance and play,
Their songs and chirps, a joyful melody each day.

A gentle stream, its waters flowing wide,
Reflects the sky above, side by side.
The mountains rise, their peaks so high and grand,
A majestic sight, in this natural land.

In Nature's arms, I find my peaceful nest,
Where love and wonder, forever rest.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
