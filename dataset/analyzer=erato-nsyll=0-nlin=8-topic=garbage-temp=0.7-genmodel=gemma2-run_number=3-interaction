 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic mountain, reaching high,
Where wrappers twist and bottles lie.
Leftover feasts, a pungent smell,
Forgotten dreams that time can tell.
A broken chair, a rusted toy,
Lost memories, a silent joy.
The earth endures this heavy weight,
A burden shared, a twisted fate. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. 🎶🎨✍️
