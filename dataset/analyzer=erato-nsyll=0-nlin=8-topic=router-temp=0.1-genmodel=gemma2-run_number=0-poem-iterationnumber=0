A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens within our dream.

It guides the flow, a tireless, hidden guide,
Through networks vast, where information hides.
A gateway built of silicon and might,
The router hums, keeping darkness at bay with light.
