 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A guiding light in the darkest night.
It's the whispered words in a lover's ear,
The gentle touch that calms all fear.

With every kiss, our hearts beat fast,
Our love grows strong and will forever last.
In each other's eyes, we see a home,
A place where we can be alone.

Love is a journey through life's joys and fears,
Through laughter and tears, it wipes away our tears.
It's the safe haven where we find our peace,
The warmth of love that never will cease.

With every breath, our love will grow,
In your arms, I know my heart belongs.
