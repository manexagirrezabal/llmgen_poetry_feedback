A whispered word, a glance across the room,
Two souls ignite, dispelling all the gloom.
A silent spark that sets the heart aflame,
And in their eyes, a love begins to claim.

A gentle touch, a hand that seeks to hold,
A symphony of feelings, stories told.
Through laughter shared and secrets whispered low,
Their bond grows stronger, watch their love bestow.

With every sunrise, passion burns so bright,
Two hearts entwined, a future filled with light.
No distance vast can ever tear them apart,
Forever bound by love's eternal art.
A tapestry woven, thread by loving thread,
Their destiny unfolds, a love that won't be dead.
