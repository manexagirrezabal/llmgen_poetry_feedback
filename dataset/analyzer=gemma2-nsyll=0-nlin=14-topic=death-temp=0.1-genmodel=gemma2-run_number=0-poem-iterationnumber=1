The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, a beating heart that starts
To slow its pace, a journey nears its end,
Where shadows dance and memories transcend.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers rise, among the souls possessed.
Beyond the veil, what secrets lie in wait?
Do stars ignite, or is it sealed by fate?

A silent curtain falls upon the stage,
No more the laughter, tears, or turning page.
Death's gentle touch, a mystery profound,
Where life and darkness intertwine and bound.
