 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come forth to stay
A whispered farewell, a final sigh
As life's last breath slips by and dies

The heart that beats no more, still stands
A monument to love and hands
That once held dear, now cold as stone
A memory left, forever known
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
