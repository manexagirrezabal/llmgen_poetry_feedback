A leather case, worn and so fine,
Holds secrets and papers that are mine.
It's carried with care, through day and night,
A symbol of work, a constant sight.

Its contents are varied, some old and new,
 Contracts and reports, all waiting to break through.
The briefcase is trusted, a faithful friend indeed,
A loyal companion, in every professional need.
