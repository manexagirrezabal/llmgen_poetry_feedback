 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Green leaves unfurl in morning light,
A symphony of birds takes flight.
Sunlight streams through branches high,
Dancing shadows softly sigh.
Gentle breeze whispers secrets sweet,
Wildflowers bloom, a vibrant treat.
Nature's canvas, vast and wide,
A masterpiece where wonders hide.
