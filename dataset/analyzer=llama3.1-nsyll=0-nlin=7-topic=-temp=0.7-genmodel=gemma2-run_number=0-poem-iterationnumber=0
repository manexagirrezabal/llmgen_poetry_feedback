The moon, a silver coin in night's dark purse,
Hangs heavy, casting shadows long and deep.
A whisper sighs through leaves, a rustling verse,
As fireflies ignite their secrets, sleep
And wake to dance among the velvet green.
A lone owl calls, a haunting, mournful plea,
And silence falls, a blanket soft and clean.
