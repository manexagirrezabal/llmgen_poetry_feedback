 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Where dreams are discarded and hopes decay.
Bottles and cans, a symphony
Of wastefulness, where nature can't hold sway.

Paper and cardboard, once filled with delight,
Now crumpled and broken, a sorry sight.
Food scraps and remnants, a pungent smell,
A testament to excess, a living hell.

We fill our landfills, a growing blight,
Ignoring the damage, day and night.
But Earth cries out, her voice soft and low,
For mindful consumption, a gentler flow.

Let's mend our ways, before it's too late,
And turn this garbage into a better fate. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  😊  Is there anything else I can help you with?
