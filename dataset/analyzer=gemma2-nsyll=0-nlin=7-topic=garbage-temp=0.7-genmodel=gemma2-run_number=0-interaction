 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Where paper dreams forever hide.
Glass shards glint, a broken crown,
While food scraps rot and fester down.
A silent scream, a choking plea,
From mountains built for you and me.
The Earth weeps tears of bitter green. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can write for you.
