A leather case, so sturdy and strong
Holds secrets and papers all day long
In meetings it's present with pride
A symbol of success, side by side

The click of the lock, a satisfying sound
As the contents are kept safely bound
A haven for documents so fine
 Protected from prying eyes that design

With laptop and notes, it's always complete
A trusted companion, on every feat
Through corridors and halls, it's a familiar sight
A briefcase full of dreams, shining bright

In the evening, its work is done
Folded up tight, its day is won
