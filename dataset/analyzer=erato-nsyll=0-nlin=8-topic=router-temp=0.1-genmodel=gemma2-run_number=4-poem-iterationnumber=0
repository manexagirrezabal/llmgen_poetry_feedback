A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance and weave through its domain,
A digital highway, easing every strain.
From distant shores to screens held close at hand,
It bridges gaps, a network's guiding strand.
The router hums, a tireless, steady beat,
Ensuring flow, where knowledge can compete.
