 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, a golden hue,
Painting clouds with shades of blue.
Leaves dance softly in the breeze,
Whispering secrets through the trees.
A babbling brook, a gentle sound,
Nature's rhythm, all around.
Stars begin to softly gleam,
A tranquil night, a peaceful dream. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you'd like to see another one on a different topic.
