 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves of green,
Where wildflowers dance in meadows bathed in dews,
And butterflies on fragile wings convene.

A babbling brook sings melodies so sweet,
As silver fish leap 'neath the willow's shade,
While birdsong fills the air, a rhythmic beat,
And nature's symphony is gently played.

The moon ascends, a pearl in velvet night,
Stars twinkle bright, like diamonds scattered wide,
A tapestry of wonder, pure and light,
Where peace descends, and weary souls can hide.

In nature's embrace, we find solace deep,
And secrets whispered while the world does sleep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
