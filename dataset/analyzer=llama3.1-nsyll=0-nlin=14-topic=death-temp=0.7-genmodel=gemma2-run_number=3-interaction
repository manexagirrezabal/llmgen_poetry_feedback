 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent hush descends upon the air,
As life's last breath escapes in whispered sigh.
The eyes that once held laughter, now stare blankly,
A canvas painted with a final dye.

The body still, a vessel laid to rest,
Its journey through this world has come to end.
But memories linger, like a gentle guest,
Reminding us of love that knows no bend.

Though tears may fall and grief may fill the heart,
Let not despair consume your fading light.
For death is but a transition, a new start,
Where souls ascend to realms of endless night.

Embrace the peace that comes with letting go,
And find solace in the seeds that life did sow. 




 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A veil descends, a hush falls on the day,
As life's last flicker fades into the night.
The heart that pulsed with joy now slips away,
And stars replace the fading candlelight.

A silent breath, a stillness in the room,
A vacant space where laughter once did dwell.
But memories bloom, like flowers in full bloom,
And stories whispered, love's sweet magic tell.

Though tears may flow and sorrow fills the air,
Know that this journey is not truly done.
For in the quiet whispers of a prayer,
A soul takes flight, a new adventure begun.

The cycle turns, from darkness into dawn,
A promise held, until our time is gone. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help.  ğŸ˜Š   Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
