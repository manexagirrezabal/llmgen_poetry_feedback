 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In silicon halls, it holds its throne
A device of wires, signals overthrown
Router's the name, connection's the goal
Linking devices, making data whole

It forwards packets with speed and might
Through the net, a pathway in sight
The router's brain, a complex machine
 Routing data, a never-ending stream

With Wi-Fi beams, it reaches far and wide
 Connecting laptops, tablets side by side
In the home or office, it holds its place
A crucial link, in the digital space

Through the noise, it finds its way
A vital tool, for a connected day
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
