 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop chats,
It's a silent witness to life's hurried pace.
Its clasps secure the hopes and anxious fats,
Of deals made swift, or time's relentless chase.

A symbol of success, a tool for trade,
A constant companion on the daily quest.
The briefcase stands, its purpose unafraid,
To carry burdens, put ambitions to the test.

So open wide, and let your journey start,
With every page turned, a brand new work of art. 



 > human: The poem doesnâ€™t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, worn smooth by time's embrace,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams within its hold.
The briefcase stands, a silent, steady face,
Through boardroom battles, stories yet untold.

It carries weight of deadlines, hopes, and fears,
A constant companion on the daily grind.
From coffee shops to meetings, through the years,
Its clasps secure ambitions we find.

A symbol of success, a tool for trade,
A journey's map, with every page unfurled.
The briefcase waits, its purpose unafraid,
To carry burdens, conquer this world.

So open wide, and let your story start,
With every step you take, a brand new work of art.
