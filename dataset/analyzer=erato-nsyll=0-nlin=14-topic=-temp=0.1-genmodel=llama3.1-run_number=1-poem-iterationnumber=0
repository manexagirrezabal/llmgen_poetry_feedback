Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
As stars above their vigil keep and fill

The night air whispers secrets to the trees
Their branches sway in gentle, soothing breeze
The wind it howls a lonely, mournful sigh
That echoes through the darkness, passing by

In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm that all my worries cease
The world may be loud and full of strife
But in the stillness, I find my life

And though the night may bring its darkest fears
I know that dawn will bring an end to tears
