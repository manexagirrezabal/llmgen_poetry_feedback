A solitary lighthouse stands on the shore,
Its beacon shining, guiding ships evermore.
Waves crash against the rocks, a rhythmic sound,
As seagulls circle overhead, and homeward bound.

The salty air is filled with whispers of the sea,
And stories untold, carried on the breeze.
Stars twinkle brightly in the velvet night,
Reflecting in the ocean's depths, a shimmering light.

The lighthouse keeper watches, ever vigilant and bold,
Protecting sailors from dangers yet untold.
A symbol of hope, standing tall and proud,
Guiding lost souls through darkness, with its guiding shroud.
