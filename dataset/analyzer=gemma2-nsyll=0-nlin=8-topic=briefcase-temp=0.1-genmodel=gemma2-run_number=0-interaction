 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Within it secrets, hopes that grasp.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
It carries burdens, dreams it makes.
A silent witness, sleek and strong,
To triumphs won and losses long.
A symbol of ambition's stride,
The briefcase journeys, side by side. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
