 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story told.
Laughter dances, tears may fall,
Love's gentle hand embraces all.
Through stormy skies and sunshine bright,
A beacon shines, a guiding light.
Forever bound, a sacred vow,
In love's embrace, we truly know. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
