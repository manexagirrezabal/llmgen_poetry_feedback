 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes where life once infused.

A gentle slumber, a release from pain,
A journey onward, beyond earthly reign.
The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories linger, secrets they will keep.

Though darkness claims us, love's light shines above,
A guiding star that whispers tales of love.
And in the tapestry of time, our threads entwined,
With every soul who's left this earthly bind.

So fear not death, its embrace is kind,
A passage to a peace we hope to find. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
