The final breath, a whisper on the air,
A fading light where life's bright flame once flared.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just silent peace, where shadows softly come.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories dance, within our hearts possessed.
But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding our souls through darkness, shining bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the day,
Hope's gentle hand will lead us on our way.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
