The final breath escapes on silent wings,
A fading ember where life brightly sings.
No more the heartbeat's steady, rhythmic sound,
Just peaceful stillness on hallowed ground.

A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now fades to gray, a design divine.
But love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls with its gentle light.

Though flesh returns to dust, the spirit flies,
On wings of hope towards ethereal skies.
A journey starts beyond the veil unseen,
Where stars ignite and dreams forever glean.
