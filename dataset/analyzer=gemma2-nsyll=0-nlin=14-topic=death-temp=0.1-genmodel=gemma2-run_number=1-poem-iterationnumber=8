A silent breath escapes, a final sigh,
The flickering flame of life begins to die.
No more the pulse, the vibrant, beating drum,
Just peaceful rest, where shadows softly come.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
Of laughter shared, and battles bravely won.

Though darkness falls, and tears may gently fall,
Love's gentle echo lingers through it all.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That opens wide to realms we've longed before.
And spirits soar, on wings of light so free,
To find new life, eternally.
