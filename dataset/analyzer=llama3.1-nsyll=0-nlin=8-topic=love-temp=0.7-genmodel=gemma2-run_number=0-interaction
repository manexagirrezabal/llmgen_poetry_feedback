 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame takes hold,
Two souls entwined, a story told.
With tender touch and whispered word,
Love's symphony, forever heard.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
A bond unbreakable, standing tall.
In every glance, a universe bright,
Love conquers darkness, shining light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
