Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep,
Moonlight whispers secrets, darkness keeps.
The night's dark veil, a mystic shroud does wear,
And stars above, in silence wait and share.

In forest depths, a lonely owl does cry,
A mournful sound that echoes through the sky.
The wind stirs leaves, a rustling whisper low,
As nature's mysteries begin to unfold below.

The darkness trembles with a secret might,
A hidden world where magic takes flight.
The moon's pale beams upon the shadows play,
Illuminating paths that lead astray.

In this midnight realm, the heart can roam free,
Where dreams and magic intertwine in ecstasy.
