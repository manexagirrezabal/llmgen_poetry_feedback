Your presence fills my world with light so warm,
A gentle radiance that shelters from the storm.
Your laughter echoes like a sweet refrain,
Chasing away all shadows, easing every pain.

With every touch, a symphony ignites,
A spark of passion burning ever bright.
Your eyes, twin stars, guide me through the night,
Illuminating paths with love's pure light.

Two souls entwined, a tapestry we weave,
Woven with threads of trust, we both believe.
Through life's adventures, hand in hand we'll roam,
Forever bound by love, our destined home.
