In silicon halls, it stands so tall,
A master of connections, one and all.
It routes the data with speed and might,
Through wires and air, a constant sight.

Its lights ablaze, like beacons bright,
As packets flow, through day and night.
It's the unseen heart, that makes us whole,
 Connecting worlds, in its digital role.
