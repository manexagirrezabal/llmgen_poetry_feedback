The final breath escapes on silent wings,
A whispered sigh, as life's bright song takes stings.
No more the laughter, tears that once did flow,
Just empty echoes where the heart used to glow.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A tapestry of moments, now grown cold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what secrets lie in wait?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits sate?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light.
