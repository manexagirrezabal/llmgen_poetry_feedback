In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through it, without a bound

Its antennas reach out, like arms so fine
Receiving and sending, in perfect time
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, to the digital thread

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
A beacon calling out, to all who claim
To join the network, and be a part of the crew
The router's power, is a wondrous thing to do

It keeps us connected, in this digital age
A vital tool, that turns the page
