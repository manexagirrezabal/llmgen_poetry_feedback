The final breath, a whisper on the breeze,
A fading light where life's bright flame once seized.
No more the pulse, the rhythm of the day,
Just silent peace, where shadows gently sway.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While memories dance, within our hearts possessed.
But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding our souls through darkness, shining bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the sky,
Hope's gentle hand will lift us, help us fly.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
