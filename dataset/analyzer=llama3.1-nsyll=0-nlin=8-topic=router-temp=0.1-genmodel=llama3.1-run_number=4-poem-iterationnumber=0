In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with calculated might
Through wires and air, a digital light

Its processor hums, as data flows by
A constant heartbeat, in the digital sky
It adapts and adjusts, to changing needs
A steadfast guardian, of our online deeds
