A briefcase, worn and brown with age,
Holds secrets whispered on life's stage.
From bustling streets to quiet rooms,
It carries burdens, conquers glooms.

Within its depths, a world resides,
Of paper dreams and hidden tides.
Contracts signed, ambitions soar,
And futures built behind closed doors.

A symbol of power, or just a tool?
A faithful friend, playing life's duel.
Whatever its purpose, it stands so strong,
A constant companion, righting every wrong.
