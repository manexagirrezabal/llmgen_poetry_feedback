The final curtain falls upon the stage,
A silent hush descends where laughter played.
The vibrant colors fade into gray,
And shadows lengthen as the light gives way.

No more the heartbeat's steady, rhythmic drum,
No whispered secrets shared beneath the sun.
A gentle breeze sighs through the empty air,
As if to say, "Life's journey now is rare."

But in the tapestry of time's grand design,
Each thread a memory, forever thine.
Though mortal shells return to dust below,
The spirit soars on wings where love may flow.
