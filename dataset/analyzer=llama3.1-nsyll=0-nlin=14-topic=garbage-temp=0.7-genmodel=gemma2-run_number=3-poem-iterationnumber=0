A mountain of refuse, piled high and deep,
Where plastic bottles and paper do sleep.
Cardboard boxes, once filled with delight,
Now lie broken in the fading sunlight.
Food scraps decaying, a pungent perfume,
Whispering tales of a wasted bloom.
A symphony of rustling, a mournful sigh,
As nature's balance begins to die.
We cast aside what we no longer need,
Blind to the damage, the toxic seed.
But in this waste, a lesson can be found,
To cherish our planet, and turn things around.
Let's mend our ways, reduce and reuse,
And leave a legacy free from refuse.
