 > assistant: Rays of sunshine filter through the trees,
A gentle breeze rustles the summer seas.
The scent of blooming flowers fills the air,
As birds sing sweetly without a single care.
The forest floor is carpeted with green,
Wildflowers sway in harmony serene.
Nature's beauty is a peaceful sight to see.
