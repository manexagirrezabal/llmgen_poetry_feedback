 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to claim the day
A final breath, a last goodbye
The heart slows down, and then it dies
 Memories linger, bittersweet pain
Fading light, a life in vain
Eternal rest, an endless sleep
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask.
