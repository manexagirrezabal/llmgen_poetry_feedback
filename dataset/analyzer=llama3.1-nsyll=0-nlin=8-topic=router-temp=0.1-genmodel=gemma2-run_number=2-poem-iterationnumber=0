A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam.

It guides the flow, a tireless, constant guide,
Through networks vast, where information hides.
A humble hero, in its plastic shell,
The router weaves the web, where stories dwell.
