 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a fading blast.
No more the sun's warm, golden ray,
Nor moonlit whispers through the day.
Just shadows dance in endless night,
Where stars are dim and dreams take flight.
And silence reigns, forever deep. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
