A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather bound and sturdy frame
Holding secrets, and papers to claim

It's carried by hands that are strong
Through streets and offices all day long
Its contents unknown, yet to be told
A mystery wrapped in a story to hold

In meetings it's opened with care
Revealing documents beyond compare
The weight of its contents is great
As deals are made, and futures create

It holds the keys to success or fate
And the burden of responsibility
