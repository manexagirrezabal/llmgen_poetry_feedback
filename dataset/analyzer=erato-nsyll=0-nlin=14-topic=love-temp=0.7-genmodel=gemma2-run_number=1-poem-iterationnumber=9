A whispered word, a touch so light and sweet,
Love's gentle flame, our hearts complete.
Two souls entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's embrace, we find our happy place.

Through fields of green where wildflowers softly sway,
Love's guiding star, illuminates the day.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths unknown,
Sharing laughter, building dreams we've sown.

With every glance, a spark ignites anew,
A love that burns with passion, strong and true.
No distance vast, no time can ever tear,
This bond we share, beyond all compare. 
Two hearts united, forever meant to be.
