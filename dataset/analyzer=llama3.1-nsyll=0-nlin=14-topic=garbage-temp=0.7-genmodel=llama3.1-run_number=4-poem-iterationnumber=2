In alleys dark and streets so wide,
A trashy tale of waste does reside.
Discarded dreams, forgotten fears,
Littering the ground through all the years.

The plastic flows like a tainted stream,
Polluting earth with its toxic dream.
Food scraps rot, a putrid stain,
On sidewalks cracked, a grimy refrain.

In landfills deep, it's buried away,
A secret shame that we'd rather not say.
But still we throw, without a care,
For the future's cost is hard to bear.

The garbage grows, a mounting weight,
A symbol of our reckless fate.
