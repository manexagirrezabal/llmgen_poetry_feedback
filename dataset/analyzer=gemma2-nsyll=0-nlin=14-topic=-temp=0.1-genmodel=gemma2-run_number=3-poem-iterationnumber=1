The sun dips low, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds with hues untold.
Crimson and violet, a vibrant blend,
As day surrenders, and shadows extend.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of earth, fresh and serene.
Stars begin to twinkle, diamonds in night,
Guiding lost souls with their ethereal light.

The moon ascends, a silver crescent bright,
Casting its glow on the world's silent plight.
Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
As nature slumbers, secrets to keep.

A symphony of crickets, a soothing sound,
Peace fills the air, as dreams abound.
