A mountain of waste, a plastic sea,
Forgotten treasures, meant to be free.
Paper and glass, in tangled despair,
A silent burden, beyond compare.
We consume and discard, with careless hand,
Leaving scars on this beautiful land.
Oh, heed the warning, the growing blight,
Let's choose wisely, for future light.
