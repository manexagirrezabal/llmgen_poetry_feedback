A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It hums a tune, connecting one and all.
Packets dance through wires, light and swift,
Across the web, a digital gift.
From distant shores to homes nearby,
It weaves a tapestry, beneath the sky.
The router reigns, a modern-day king,
A gateway to worlds, where knowledge takes wing.
