 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two hearts entwined, in love's sweet overflow.
A gentle touch, a whispered word so kind,
A bond unbreakable, forever enshrined.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Their love endures, through sunshine and through squall.
A silent glance, a knowing smile they share,
A symphony of souls, beyond compare.

In trust they find, a haven safe and true,
Where dreams take flight, and hopes forever renew.
With every passing day, their love takes hold,
A tapestry of passion, stories yet untold.

Two souls as one, in unity they stand,
Forever bound by love's eternal hand. 



 > human: Thank you!
