The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony rustling, stories untold.
Sunlight paints shadows, long and serene,
As autumn's embrace turns the world evergreen.

Crimson and amber, a vibrant display,
Nature's masterpiece, fading with each day.
Squirrels gather treasures, winter's approach,
While geese fly southward, on wings that encroach.

A chill in the air, a hint of frost's kiss,
Memories linger, moments we miss.
But beauty remains, in every hue bright,
A final farewell to summer's warm light.

And as darkness descends, stars softly gleam,
Whispering promises of a winter dream.
