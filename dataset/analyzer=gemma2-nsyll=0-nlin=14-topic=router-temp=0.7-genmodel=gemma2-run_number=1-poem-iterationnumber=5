A humble box, unassuming in its place,
The router hums, with tireless, steady grace.
A web of wires, weaving through the night,
Connecting lives, both dark and shining bright.

From distant shores to screens that softly glow,
It sends our thoughts, where stories ebb and flow.
A silent shepherd, guiding data's stream,
A modern marvel, fulfilling every dream.

With every click, a world unfolds anew,
Shared laughter, tears, connections strong and true.
So raise a glass to this unsung hero bold,
The router's magic, worth more than silver or gold.
