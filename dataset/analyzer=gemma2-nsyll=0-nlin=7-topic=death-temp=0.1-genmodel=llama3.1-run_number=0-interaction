 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's cold hand does creep
A silent thief, in endless sleep
It takes our breath, and seals our fate
Leaving memories, an empty state
The living mourn, with tears and sighs
As death's dark shadow passes by
Eternal rest, for mortal eyes
 > human: Thank you!
