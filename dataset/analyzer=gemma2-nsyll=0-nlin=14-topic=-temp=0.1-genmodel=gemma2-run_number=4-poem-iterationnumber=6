A single candle flickers in the night,
Casting dancing shadows, soft and light.
The wind whispers secrets through leaves so green,
As darkness descends, a tranquil scene.

Stars begin to glimmer, diamonds in the sky,
Guiding lost souls with their ethereal eye.
Silence falls softly, a blanket deep and wide,
While weary world prepares for slumber's tide.

A gentle breeze carries the scent of pine,
And crickets chirp their lullaby divine.
The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Watching over dreams as hours drift by.
