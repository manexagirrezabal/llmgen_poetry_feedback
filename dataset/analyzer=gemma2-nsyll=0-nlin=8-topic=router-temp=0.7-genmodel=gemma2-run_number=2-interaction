 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, sleek and small,
Directs the data's constant call.
Packets flow through wires unseen,
Connecting worlds, both bright and keen.
From home to office, far and wide,
The router guides with steady stride.
A silent guardian, ever true,
Keeping us linked, me and you. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  🖋️  🚀
