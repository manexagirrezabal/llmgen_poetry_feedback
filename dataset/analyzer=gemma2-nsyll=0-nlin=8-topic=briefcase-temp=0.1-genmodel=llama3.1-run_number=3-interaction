 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather briefcase, worn with care
Holds secrets and papers beyond compare
Its metal clasps shine like polished gold
As it's carried by hands that are bold

Through meetings and deals, it's always near
A symbol of power, a trusted peer
It holds the weight of business and fate
And keeps its contents in a secure state
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
