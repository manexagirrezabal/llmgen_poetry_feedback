A silent sentinel, unassuming in its form,
The router hums, amidst the digital storm.
Packets dance and weave, through circuits deep and wide,
Connecting distant dreams, where secrets gently hide.

From bustling cities to quiet countryside,
It bridges gaps, with information's tide.
A symphony of signals, flowing ever strong,
Guiding voices, laughter, righting every wrong.

With every click, a world unfolds anew,
In shared connections, friendships bloom and grew.
So let us celebrate this marvel, small and bright,
The router's magic, guiding day into night.
