 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Green leaves whisper secrets in the breeze,
Sunbeams dance on moss-covered trees.
A babbling brook sings a gentle rhyme,
While birdsong fills the air with chime.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's beauty, a wondrous view.
Peace descends where wild things roam free.
