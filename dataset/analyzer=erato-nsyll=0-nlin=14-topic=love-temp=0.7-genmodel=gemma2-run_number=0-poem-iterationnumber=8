A silent promise in a whispered word,
Two souls awakened, love's banner unfurled.
Eyes that meet and hold a universe bright,
Igniting passions, burning through the night.

With gentle touch, they chase away the gloom,
Sharing secrets hidden in life's bloom.
Laughter dances, light upon their face,
A symphony of love, time cannot erase.

Through trials faced, their bond will never break,
Love's guiding star, a promise they partake.
Forever intertwined, destinies aligned,
Two hearts united, forever enshrined.
