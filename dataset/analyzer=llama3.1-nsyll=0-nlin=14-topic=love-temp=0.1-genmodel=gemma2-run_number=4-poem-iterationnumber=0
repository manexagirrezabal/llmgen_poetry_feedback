A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

Time may pass, seasons change their hue,
But love endures, steadfast and true.
A tapestry woven with threads of gold,
A story whispered, never to grow old.

In every beat, a symphony of bliss,
Love's eternal dance, sealed with a kiss.
