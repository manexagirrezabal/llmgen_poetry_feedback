 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent darkness claims its own
A final breath, and life is gone
The clock ticks on, unmoved by pain
As mortal hearts begin to wane

Of love and joy, of life complete
In death's cold grasp, we find our end
And eternal rest, where love transcends
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
