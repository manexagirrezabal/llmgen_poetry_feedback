A whispered word, a glance across the room,
A silent spark that sets the heart aflame.
Two souls collide, dispelling all the gloom,
And in their eyes, a love begins to claim.

A gentle touch, a hand that seeks to hold,
A symphony of feelings, soft and deep.
Through stories shared, their bond will unfold,
A promise whispered while they softly sleep.

With every sunrise, love's embrace grows strong,
Two hearts entwined, where they forever belong.
No distance vast can ever tear them apart,
For in each other's arms, they find their art.

And as the years go by, their love will shine,
A beacon bright, a testament divine.
