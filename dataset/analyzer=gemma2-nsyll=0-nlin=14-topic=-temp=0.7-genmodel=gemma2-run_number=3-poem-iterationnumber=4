The sun descends, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds in hues of pink and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers through branches high,
As twilight's embrace begins to unfold.

Stars ignite, like diamonds scattered bright,
Upon a canvas dark and deep and wide.
The moon ascends, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls with its ethereal tide.

Shadows lengthen, stretching long and thin,
And crickets chirp a lullaby so sweet.
A world at peace, where worries fade within,
As slumber's gentle touch brings solace complete.

Night descends, a blanket soft and deep,
Inviting weary hearts to peaceful sleep.
