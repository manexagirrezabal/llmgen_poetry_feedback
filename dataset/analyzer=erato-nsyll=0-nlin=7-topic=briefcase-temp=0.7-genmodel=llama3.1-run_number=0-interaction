 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase by my side
Carrying secrets, documents with pride
Its leather worn, its metal strong
It holds the weight of business all day long
A symbol of professionalism and might
A trusted companion through dawn's early light
Filling lives with purpose, one meeting at a time.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
