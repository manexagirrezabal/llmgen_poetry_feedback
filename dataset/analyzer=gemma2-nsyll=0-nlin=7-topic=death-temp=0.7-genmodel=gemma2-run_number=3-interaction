 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A final breath, a fading light,
The curtains close on day and night.
A whispered sigh, a silent tear,
A journey ends, a soul held dear.
In shadows deep, a resting place,
Where memories dance with time and grace.
Death's gentle touch, a sweet release.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š
