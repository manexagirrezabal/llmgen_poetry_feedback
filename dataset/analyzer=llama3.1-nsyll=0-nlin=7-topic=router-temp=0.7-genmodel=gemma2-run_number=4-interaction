 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box unseen, a silent guide,
It weaves a web where data ride.
Through wires thin and signals bright,
It links our worlds both day and night.
From screen to screen, a constant flow,
The router's work, we rarely know.
Yet life's connected, thanks to its might. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
