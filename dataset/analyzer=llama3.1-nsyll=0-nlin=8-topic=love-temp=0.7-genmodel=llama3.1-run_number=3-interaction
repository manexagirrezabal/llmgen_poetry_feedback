 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can never fade,
A connection that's made with every glance displayed.

In its arms we find our peaceful nest,
Where worries cease and love finds rest.
With every beat, it grows more true,
Forever a bond between me and you.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
