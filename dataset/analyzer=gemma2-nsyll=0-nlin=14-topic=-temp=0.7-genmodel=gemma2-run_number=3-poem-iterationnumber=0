The sun descends, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds with hues of pink and red.
A gentle breeze whispers tales untold,
As shadows lengthen, secrets softly spread.

Stars begin to glimmer in the night,
Diamonds scattered on a velvet sheet.
The moon, a silver beacon, shining bright,
Guiding lost souls with its ethereal heat.

Silence descends, a blanket soft and deep,
Except for crickets chirping in the grass.
A world asleep, where worries cease to keep,
And dreams take flight, as moments gently pass.

Night's embrace, a haven calm and still,
Inviting weary hearts to rest and heal.
