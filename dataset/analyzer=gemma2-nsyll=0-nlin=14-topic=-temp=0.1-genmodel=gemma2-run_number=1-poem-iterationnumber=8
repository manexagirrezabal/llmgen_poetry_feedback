The sun descends, a fiery ball of gold,
Kissing the hills as stories unfold.
Long shadows dance, a silent, graceful sway,
As twilight paints the world in hues of gray.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of earth, a tranquil scene.
Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Their silent dance, beneath the silver moon.

The crickets chirp their lullaby so sweet,
While owls take flight, on silent, feathered feet.
The world is hushed, in slumber deep and sound,
As peace descends, on hallowed ground.
