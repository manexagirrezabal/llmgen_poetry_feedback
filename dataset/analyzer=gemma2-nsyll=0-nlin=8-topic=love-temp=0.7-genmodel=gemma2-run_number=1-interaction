 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whispered word, a gentle touch,
A flame that burns with longing much.
Two souls entwined, a sacred trust,
In every glance, a love that must.
Through laughter shared and tears that fall,
A bond unbreakable, standing tall.
Forever bound, in hearts so deep,
Love's tender promise, secrets to keep. 



 > human: Thank you!
