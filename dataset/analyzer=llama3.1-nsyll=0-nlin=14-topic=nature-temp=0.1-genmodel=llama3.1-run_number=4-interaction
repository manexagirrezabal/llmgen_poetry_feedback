 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks reaching high into the light.
The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting the beauty that nature keeps.

The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
A haven for the creatures that are seen.
The birds sing sweet, their melodies so bright,
Filling my heart with joy and delight.

In nature's arms, I find my peaceful nest,
Where worries fade and love finds rest.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem for you that captures the beauty of nature. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
