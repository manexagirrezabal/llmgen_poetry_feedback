 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In leather-bound and sturdy frame,
A symbol of power, it's often claimed.
The briefcase stands, with pride and might,
A tool for success, in morning light.

Within its depths, papers and pens reside,
Important documents, that must abide.
The weight of responsibility it bears,
As one carries it, with careful airs.

Through meetings and deals, it makes its way,
A trusted companion, day by day.
Its handles worn, from frequent use,
A testament to the work it produces.

With closing hours, it's left behind,
But memories linger, of tasks aligned.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
