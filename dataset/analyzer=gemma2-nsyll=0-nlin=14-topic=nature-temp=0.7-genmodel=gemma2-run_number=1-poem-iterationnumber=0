The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves so green,
A gentle breeze whispers through branches tall.
A babbling brook sings a melodious scene,
As wildflowers bloom, answering nature's call.

The sky unfolds in hues of azure bright,
With clouds like cotton drifting softly by.
A cardinal's song fills the air with light,
And butterflies on fragile wings take flight.

Beneath the towering oak, a squirrel plays,
A symphony of life, both grand and small.
In nature's embrace, our worries fade away,
Replaced by peace that conquers one and all.

From dawn till dusk, a vibrant tapestry,
Nature's beauty sets our spirits free.
