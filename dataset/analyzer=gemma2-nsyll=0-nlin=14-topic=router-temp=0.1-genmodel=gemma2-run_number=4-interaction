 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making connections known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
Data flows like rivers, swift and bright,
Illuminating darkness with its light.

A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
Where stories shared and secrets reside.
But hidden within its plastic shell,
A complex dance of signals, it compels.

So thank the router, small but mighty friend,
For bridging gaps and journeys without end. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
