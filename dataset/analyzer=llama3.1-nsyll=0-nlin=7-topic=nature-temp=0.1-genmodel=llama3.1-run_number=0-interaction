 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wildflowers with glee.
The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting beauty in a peaceful sleep.
Nature's splendor is a sight to keep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
