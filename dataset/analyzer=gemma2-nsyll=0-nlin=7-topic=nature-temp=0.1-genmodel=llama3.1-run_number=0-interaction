 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Their gentle sway a soothing sight.
The river flows with waters cold,
Reflecting beauty yet to be told.
In nature's peace my soul takes flight.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something you enjoyed. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
