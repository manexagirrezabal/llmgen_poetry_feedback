 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A mountain of plastic, a sea of despair,
Broken bottles, beyond compare.
Food scraps and wrappers, a symphony of waste,
Our careless habits, a bitter taste.
Landfills grow larger, a grim reality,
While nature cries out, for a chance to be free.
Let's choose to discard with mindful care. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
