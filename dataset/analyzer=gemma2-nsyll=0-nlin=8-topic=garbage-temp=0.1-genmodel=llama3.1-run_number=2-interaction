 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and discarded things,
A messy sight that brings us kings.

Of pollution's heavy, crushing weight,
The earth cries out in a desperate state.
We must reduce, reuse, and recycle too,
For the future's sake, our actions shine through.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about garbage that resonated with you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
