A silent sigh, a breath that softly goes,
Life's vibrant flame extinguished as it flows.
The tapestry unfurled, its colors fade to gray,
As souls embark on journeys, come what may.

Through veils of night, they wander, free and bold,
To realms unknown, where stories will unfold.
Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's guiding light will lead us through the rain.

In memories held dear, our loved ones reside,
Forever etched within our souls' deep tide.
Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever glean.
No longer bound by earthly chains we see.
