The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds with hues of rose and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so high,
As stories ancient in the forest unfold.

The babbling brook sings a melodious tune,
Reflecting stars that begin to softly gleam.
The moon ascends, bathing all in silver soon,
And fireflies dance in nature's vibrant dream.

A symphony of crickets fills the air,
While owls awake with their haunting call so clear.
In stillness deep, where shadows gently dare,
Life finds its peace, dispelling every fear.

Nature's embrace, a sanctuary divine,
Where beauty whispers and the soul can shine.
