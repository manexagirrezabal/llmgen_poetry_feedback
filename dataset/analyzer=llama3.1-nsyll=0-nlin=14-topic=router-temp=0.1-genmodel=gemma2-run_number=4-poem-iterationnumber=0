A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
The router hums, a constant, gentle drone,
Connecting worlds, making data known.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a tapestry across the land.
A symphony of packets, swift and bright,
Guiding information through day and night.

With every click, a journey it does pave,
Through fiber optic veins, a digital wave.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal wide,
The router stands, our constant digital guide.
So let us praise this humble, unseen friend,
Whose silent service knows no end.
