 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, secrets reside,
Deals struck, dreams both far and wide.
From boardroom battles to coffee breaks,
The briefcase journeys, for fortune's stakes.
A silent witness, it bears the weight,
Of triumphs won and futures fate. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 🖋️✨
