A plastic ocean, swirling, gray and wide,
Where bottles bob and cans their stories hide.
Forgotten lunches, dreams that went awry,
In overflowing bins, beneath a leaden sky.

The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
Where nature's balance struggles to embrace.
Landfills grow, consuming time and space,
A heavy burden on this weary race.

But even here, a single flower blooms,
Amidst the refuse, dispelling all our glooms.
A fragile hope, defying all our doom,
To mend our ways, and turn the tide's dark plume.
