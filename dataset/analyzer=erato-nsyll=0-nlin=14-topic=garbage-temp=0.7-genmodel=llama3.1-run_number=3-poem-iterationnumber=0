In alleys dark and streets so bright,
Lies trash that's tossed with careless might.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in dismay and pain,
As human greed brings forth this stain.
The once-green fields now lie in gray,
A graveyard for our throwaway day.

The stench of rot and putrid smell,
Fills lungs with fumes that choke so well.
Our actions bring this toxic fate,
And leave the future to an uncertain state.

We must rethink, reduce, and reuse,
Before the earth's last breath we refuse.
