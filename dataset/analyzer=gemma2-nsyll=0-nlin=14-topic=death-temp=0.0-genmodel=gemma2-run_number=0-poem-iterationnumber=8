The final curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
A silent hush descends, leaving its mark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hue,
Just empty echoes where dreams danced anew.

A gentle slumber, a release from pain,
A journey onward, beyond earthly reign.
The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories linger, secrets they will keep.

Though darkness claims us, love's light shines above,
A guiding star that whispers tales of love.
And in the tapestry of time, our threads entwined,
With every soul who's left this earthly bind.
