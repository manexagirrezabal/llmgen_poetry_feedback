 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in command.

No words are needed, feelings understood,
A tapestry of trust, woven with good.
In every glance, a universe unfolds,
A story written, as time gently molds.

Love's symphony plays on, sweet and serene,
A timeless melody, forever evergreen. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
