 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a metal tide,
Where paper boats forever ride.
Glass shards gleam, a broken dream,
And food scraps rot, a putrid stream.
We cast it out, with careless hand,
A burden left on barren land.
The Earth groans low, beneath our waste. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! ✍️✨
