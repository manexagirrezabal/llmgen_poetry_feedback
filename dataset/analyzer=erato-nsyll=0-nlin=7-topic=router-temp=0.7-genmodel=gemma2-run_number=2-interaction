 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Data streams flow, through its intricate maze,
Bridging distances, in digital haze.
From simple searches to video calls,
It fuels our world, answering every call.
The router hums, a vital, hidden force. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
