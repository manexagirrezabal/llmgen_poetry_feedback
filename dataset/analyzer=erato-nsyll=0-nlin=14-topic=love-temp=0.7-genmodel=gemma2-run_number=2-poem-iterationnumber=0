A whisper soft, a glance that holds the sun,
A touch that sends a shiver down my spine.
Your laughter rings, a melody begun,
And in your eyes, a universe I find.

The world fades out, a blur of muted sound,
As we stand close, our souls entwined as one.
No words are needed, love's embrace profound,
A silent language spoken, just begun.

Your hand in mine, a promise gently made,
To walk this path, through sunshine and the rain.
With every beat, my heart forever swayed,
By love that sets my soul aflame again. 

And as we dance beneath the moonlit sky,
I know our love will never truly die.
