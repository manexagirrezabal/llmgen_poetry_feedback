The sun dips low, a fiery ball of gold,
Painting the clouds with hues untold.
Long shadows stretch, as day surrenders night,
And stars begin to pierce the fading light.

A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
Carrying scents of earth and summer's sheen.
Fireflies dance, their tiny lights aglow,
As crickets chirp a lullaby below.

The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Casting its spell across the velvet sky.
Silence descends, a peaceful, tranquil scene,
Where dreams take flight, and worries intervene.

Sleep's embrace awaits, a welcome reprieve,
Until the dawn awakens, fresh and brief.
