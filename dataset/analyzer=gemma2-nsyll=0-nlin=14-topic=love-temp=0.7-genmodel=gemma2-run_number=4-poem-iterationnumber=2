Your smile, a sunrise, warm and bright,
Dispels the shadows, fills me with light.
My heart beats fast, a joyful drum,
For in your arms, my love has come.

A touch so soft, a tender kiss,
Ignites a fire, pure bliss.
With you beside me, I'm complete,
Our love a symphony, bittersweet.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand,
We'll write our story, understand.
Two souls entwined, forever bound,
Love's melody, profound.

In your embrace, I find my way,
My heart will sing, come what may.
