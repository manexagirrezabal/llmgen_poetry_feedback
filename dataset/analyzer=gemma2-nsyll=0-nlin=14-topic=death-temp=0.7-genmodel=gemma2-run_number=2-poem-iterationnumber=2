The final breath, a silent, gentle sigh,
A fading light, where shadows softly creep.
No longer bound by earth and mortal tie,
The soul takes flight, from slumber to the deep.

A whispered name, a memory's embrace,
Love lingers on, though absence fills the air.
In dreams we meet, in that ethereal space,
And find solace there, beyond compare.

Though tears may fall, and grief may hold us fast,
Hope's gentle hand will lead us through the night.
A starlit path, where love forever lasts,
A beacon bright, a guiding, sacred light.

So let us grieve, yet trust in time's embrace,
And find peace knowing death is but a trace.
