A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
Connecting worlds where secrets softly sleep.
Packets race through wires, unseen, unknown,
Building bridges 'twixt hearts that feel alone.

From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam,
It shares our stories, fulfilling every dream.
A silent shepherd, guiding data's flow,
Connecting lives, wherever they may go.

With every click, a world begins to bloom,
Shared laughter echoes through each darkened room.
So raise a glass to this unsung hero bold,
The router's magic, worth more than silver or gold.
