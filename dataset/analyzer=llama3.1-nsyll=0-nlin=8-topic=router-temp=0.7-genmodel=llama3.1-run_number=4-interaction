 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In the corner of my room so fine,
A small device that's always on my mind.
The router hums and buzzes with gentle might,
Connecting me to the digital light.

It routes the signals with precision and care,
Allowing me to access what I need to share.
From emails to videos, it makes them appear,
A tiny hero, always working without fear.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
