 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with digital sheen.
Packets dance through its intricate maze,
Sharing stories in a fleeting daze.
Wi-Fi's whisper, a gentle hum,
Bridging gaps, where data has come.
The router reigns, a modern day king. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ðŸ˜Š
