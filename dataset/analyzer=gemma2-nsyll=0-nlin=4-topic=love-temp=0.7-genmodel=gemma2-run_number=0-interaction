 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignited, hearts aflame,
Two souls entwined, whispering your name.
A bond unbreakable, a love so true,
Forever bound, me and you.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
