Your smile, a sunrise, chasing shadows away,
A beacon of warmth that lights up my day.
With every glance, my heart skips a beat so fast,
Lost in your beauty, a love meant to last.

Your touch, a feather, soft upon my skin,
Awakens longings deep within.
We dance as one, beneath a starlit sky,
Two souls connected, reaching ever high.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand we'll roam,
Forever bound by love, our hearts will call home.
A bond unbreakable, forever to remain,
Our love, a masterpiece, whispered like rain.
