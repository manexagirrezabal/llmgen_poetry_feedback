A whispered word, a touch so light and warm,
Two souls entwined, weathering life's harsh storm.
Laughter dances on the breeze, sweet and free,
Sharing dreams beneath a canopy of glee.

Eyes that sparkle, reflecting love's pure flame,
Weaving memories, whispering each name.
Hand in hand they walk, through sunlit days,
A bond unyielding, in countless loving ways.

Through changing seasons, their hearts beat as one,
Love's timeless melody has just begun.
Forever bound, a symphony of grace,
Finding solace in love's warm embrace.
Two souls entwined, time cannot displace.
