A whispered word, a tender touch so light,
Love's gentle flame, burns ever bright.
Two hearts entwined, a symphony of grace,
In love's sweet dance, we find our happy place.

Through fields of green and skies of azure hue,
Love's guiding star, shines just for me and you.
Hand in hand, we walk on paths unknown,
Sharing laughter, making dreams our own.

With every glance, a spark ignites anew,
A love that burns with passion, strong and true.
No distance vast, no time can ever tear,
This bond we share, beyond all compare. 
Two souls united, forever meant to be.
