A fading light, a breath that softly sighs,
Life's tapestry unfurled before our eyes.
The final curtain falls, a gentle hush descends,
As earthly bonds dissolve and journeys transcend.

No longer bound by time's relentless sway,
We sail towards the stars, where spirits play.
Though grief may linger, love will light the way,
A guiding beacon through the night's dark gray.

In memories held dear, our loved ones reside,
Forever etched within our hearts' deep tide.
Death's gentle touch, a passage unforeseen,
To realms of peace, where spirits ever glean.

No longer bound by earthly chains we see,
