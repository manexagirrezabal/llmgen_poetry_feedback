The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
A symphony of rustling, soft and low.
Sunlight paints the meadow, stories told
In hues of amber where wildflowers grow.

A lone bird sings a melody so sweet,
A mournful tune that echoes in the air.
Autumn's embrace, a bittersweet retreat,
As summer's warmth begins to disappear.

Crimson leaves descend upon the ground,
A vibrant carpet, nature's final art.
The world prepares for winter's silent sound,
A time of rest, a brand new, hopeful start.

And in this stillness, peace begins to bloom,
A quiet beauty fills the fading room.
