The final breath escapes on silent wings,
A whispered sigh where life's sweet song now sings.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just quiet peace where shadows gently come.

The world moves on, oblivious and bright,
While stars above reflect a somber night.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
Of laughter shared, and love's enduring run.

A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now rests in silence, where all things entwine.
Though earthly bonds may break and spirits fly,
Love's echo lingers, reaching for the sky.
