A whispered sigh, a final breath released,
The body stills, its earthly journey ceased.
No more the laughter, no familiar sound,
Just silent echoes where joy once was found.

But memories linger, like stars in night's embrace,
Guiding our steps with love and gentle grace.
Though tears may fall, and sorrow fills the air,
Hope's tender light shines ever bright and fair.

For death is not an ending, but a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar once more.
And though we grieve, their essence will remain,
A timeless echo whispering love's refrain.
