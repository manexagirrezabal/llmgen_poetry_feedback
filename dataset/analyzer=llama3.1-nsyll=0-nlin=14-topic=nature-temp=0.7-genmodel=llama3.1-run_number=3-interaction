 > assistant: The forest whispers secrets low
Of ancient trees that stand and grow
Their leaves rustle, a gentle breeze
That stirs the wildflowers in ease

The sun shines bright with warm delight
Bringing life to all in sight
The river flows with crystal stream
Reflecting mountains, calm and serene

A hawk soars high, its wings outspread
Riding thermals on the wind's soft thread
In fields of green, wildflowers sway
Dancing to the breeze's gentle way

Morning dew glistens on each blade

And nature's beauty is forever made
