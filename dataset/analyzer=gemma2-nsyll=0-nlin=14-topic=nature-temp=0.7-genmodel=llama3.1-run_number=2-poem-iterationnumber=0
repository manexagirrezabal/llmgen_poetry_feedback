The mountains stand, a majestic sight
Their peaks reaching high into the light
Trees sway gently in the breeze's caress
Their leaves rustling softly, a soothing stress

A river flows, its waters pure and bright
Reflecting sunbeams that dance with delight
A forest blooms, with colors vibrant and bold
A haven for wildlife, young and old

The wind whispers secrets through the trees so tall
And in the distance, a waterfall's gentle call
The earthy scent of dampened soil is sweet
As petals unfurl, and new life meets

In nature's realm, all worries fade away
And peace descends, to stay.
