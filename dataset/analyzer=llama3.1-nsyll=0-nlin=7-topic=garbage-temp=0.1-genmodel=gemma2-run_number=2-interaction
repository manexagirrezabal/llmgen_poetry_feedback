 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.
Forgotten dreams in cardboard sleep,
While styrofoam mountains creep.
A silent stench, a buzzing fly,
The earth groans under this heavy sigh.
Will beauty bloom where garbage lies? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
