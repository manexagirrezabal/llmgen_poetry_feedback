 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A mountain high, a dismal fact.

The smell of rot and decay fills air,
As nature's beauty is beyond repair.
We reap what we sow, it's plain to see,
A world of waste, a tragedy.

Let's reduce, reuse, recycle with care,
And show the earth we truly do dare.
 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
