 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Plastic mountains, paper peaks,
A symphony of cans and leaks.
Forgotten meals and wrappers strewn,
A landscape choked, a future doomed.
We build our empires, waste by waste,
And leave behind a bitter taste.
Oh, garbage, tell us what we've done. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? 😊  Perhaps another poem on a different topic? ✍️
