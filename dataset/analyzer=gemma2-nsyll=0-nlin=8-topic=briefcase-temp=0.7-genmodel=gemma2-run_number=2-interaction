 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a sturdy frame,
It holds secrets whispered in its name.
Deals struck, dreams spun within its hold,
Stories untold, both brave and bold.
Across the city, through bustling streets,
It travels light on hurried feet.
A symbol of ambition, work, and might,
The briefcase strides into the fading light. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
