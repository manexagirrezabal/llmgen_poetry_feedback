 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A hush descends, the light grows dim,
A final breath, a whispered hymn.
The body stills, a silent sleep,
While memories dance and shadows creep.
Across the veil, a journey starts,
To realms unknown, where love imparts
Eternal peace, beyond the heart. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can create for you. ðŸ˜Š
