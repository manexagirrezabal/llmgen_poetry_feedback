The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Where wildflowers bloom in vibrant weaves,
And butterflies with colors rare,

Float through the meadows, soft and green,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets low,
Through towering trees, a tranquil scene,
Where nature's beauty starts to grow.

The babbling brook, a crystal stream,
Reflects the sky of azure bright,
A canvas painted in a waking dream,
Bathed in golden, warm sunlight.

Oh, wondrous world, so full of grace,
Nature's embrace, a sacred space.
