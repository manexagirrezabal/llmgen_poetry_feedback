 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly ride.
Forgotten dreams in crumpled foil,
And broken toys that once did toil.
A silent scream, a choking plea,
From mountains high for all to see.
Oh, garbage, what will you become? 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
