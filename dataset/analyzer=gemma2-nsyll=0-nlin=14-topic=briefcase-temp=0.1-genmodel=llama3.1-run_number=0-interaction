 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather-bound and sturdy as can be
A holder of secrets, for you and me

It carries papers, files, and more
The weight of work, it holds in store
A daily companion, through and through
From dawn till dusk, it's always true

In meetings and conferences, it's by your side
A trusted friend, that never will divide
Its contents are private, its purpose grand
A briefcase is a tool, in this busy land

It's a reflection of our daily strife
A holder of dreams, and a symbol of life
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
