A box of circuits, humming low,
Connecting worlds, to and fro.
Packets dance, a digital tide,
Through wires spun, where secrets hide.

From distant shores to screens so bright,
It sends our thoughts, both day and night.
A silent guardian, ever true,
Guiding signals, me and you.

The router's heart, a steady beat,
Keeps us linked, from head to feet.
In every click, in every scroll,
Its magic touch makes stories whole.

A modern marvel, small and sleek,
The world connected, week by week.
