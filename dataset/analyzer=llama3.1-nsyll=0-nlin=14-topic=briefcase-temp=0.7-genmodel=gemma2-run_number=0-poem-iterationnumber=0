A rigid shell of leather, dark and sleek,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily schemes.
Within its clasp, ambitions interweave,
And secrets whispered in fluorescent beams.

From boardroom battles to coffee shop haze,
The briefcase marches through a world of strife.
A silent witness to anxious, hurried days,
Where deals are struck and futures take their life.

A symbol of success, or hidden fear,
It bears the burden of both triumph and plight.
But in its emptiness, a chance appears,
To leave behind the shadows of the night.

For when it's closed, and carried light and free,
The briefcase holds the promise yet to be.
