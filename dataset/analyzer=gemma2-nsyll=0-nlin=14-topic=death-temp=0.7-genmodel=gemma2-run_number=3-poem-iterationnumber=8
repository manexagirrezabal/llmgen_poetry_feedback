A crimson sunset paints the sky ablaze,
As twilight whispers secrets through the haze.
A final heartbeat fades, a gentle sigh,
And life's grand tapestry begins to die.

No more the laughter, no familiar sound,
Just silent echoes on hallowed ground.
Yet love remains, a beacon in the night,
Guiding lost souls toward eternal light.

Though grief may linger, holding us so tight,
Remember joy's sweet echo, pure and bright.
For death is but a doorway, leading on,
To realms unknown, where spirits journey long.
