 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather-bound and sturdy as can be
A holder for papers, a keeper of secrets to see

It's carried by hands that are strong and sure
Through crowded streets, through office floor
A trusted companion, a loyal friend indeed
A place to store the documents we need

Inside its depths, a world is revealed
 Contracts and reports, stories unsealed
The briefcase holds them all with care
A keeper of dreams, a holder of fare

It's more than just a bag, it's a part of us too
A reflection of our work, our goals in view
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
