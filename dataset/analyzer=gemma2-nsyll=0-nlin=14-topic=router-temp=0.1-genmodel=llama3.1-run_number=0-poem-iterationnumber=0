In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across distant lands
It navigates the web, with precision fine
Directing packets, in a digital line

With Wi-Fi waves, it broadcasts its name
A beacon calling, to devices that claim
Their place within the network's fold
As the router weaves, their connections to hold

In this digital age, it plays its part
A behind-the-scenes hero, with a gentle heart
