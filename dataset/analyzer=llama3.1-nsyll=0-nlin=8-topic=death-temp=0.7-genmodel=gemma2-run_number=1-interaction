 > assistant: A silent curtain falls at last,
The final breath, a fading cast.
The body sleeps, a shell now still,
Where life's bright flame burned on the hill.
But memories bloom like flowers fair,
And whispers drift on gentle air.
Though darkness claims its earthly hold,
Love's embers glow, in stories told. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š   Let me know if you have any other requests.  Poetry is always a fun challenge!
