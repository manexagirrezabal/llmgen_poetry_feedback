A whisper soft, a breath that fades away,
The final curtain falls on life's bright stage.
A silent hush descends, where shadows play,
And memories linger, turning every page.

No more the pulse that quickened in the breast,
No more the laughter echoing through halls.
Only a stillness, a profound unrest,
As darkness claims the body, breaks its walls.

But is this ending, or just a start?
A journey taken to a distant shore?
Where souls reunite, and spirits impart
Their wisdom gained, forevermore.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
In death's embrace, perhaps we find our gain.
