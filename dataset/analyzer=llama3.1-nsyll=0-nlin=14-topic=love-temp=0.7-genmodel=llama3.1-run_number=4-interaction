 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A gentle warmth that lights up the night.
It's the whispered words in a lover's ear,
The tender touch that calms all fear.

It's the laughter shared on a sunny day,
The adventures taken, come what may.
It's the quiet moments when hearts beat as one,
The love that's shared beneath the morning sun.

Love is a feeling that cannot be tamed,
A force that's strong and forever claimed.
It's the sacrifices made for another's sake,
The unconditional love that heart doth make.

In its purest form, it knows no bounds,
And in its presence, hearts are found.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about love to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
