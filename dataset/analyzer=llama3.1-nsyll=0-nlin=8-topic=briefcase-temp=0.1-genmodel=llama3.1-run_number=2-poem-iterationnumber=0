A briefcase sits upon my floor
Filled with papers and documents galore
Its leather worn, its seams now tight
A symbol of work, day and night

It holds my secrets, my plans, my fears
The weight of responsibility it bears
Through meetings and deals, it's by my side
A trusted companion, never to subside
