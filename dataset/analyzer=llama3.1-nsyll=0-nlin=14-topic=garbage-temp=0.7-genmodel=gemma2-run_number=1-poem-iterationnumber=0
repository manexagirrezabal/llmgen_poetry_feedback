A mountain of refuse, towering high,
Plastic and paper, metal reaching for the sky.
Once cherished objects, now discarded and torn,
Forgotten treasures, silently mourned.

The stench of decay, a bitter perfume,
Whispers of consumption, sealing our doom.
Landfills expand, devouring the earth,
A testament to waste, a tragic rebirth.

Can we mend our ways, this reckless spree?
Recycle, reduce, plant a hopeful tree.
Lest future generations face a world forlorn,
Where garbage reigns supreme, and beauty is torn. 

We must act now, before it's too late,
To heal the planet, and seal its fate.
