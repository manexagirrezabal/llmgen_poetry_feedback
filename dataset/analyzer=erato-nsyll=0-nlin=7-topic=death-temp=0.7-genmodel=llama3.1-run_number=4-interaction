 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Death's dark shadow falls upon my door
A silent visitor, forever more
It claims the living, young and old
Leaving memories, cold and still to hold
The final farewell, a lonely sigh
Echoes of life, that fade away to die
In eternal rest, our journeys end
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you'd like me to create another poem on a different topic or with specific requirements, feel free to let me know.
