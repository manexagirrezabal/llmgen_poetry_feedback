 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent streams swirl silver shadows deep
Moonlight dances on the midnight sleep
The world is hushed in quiet, dark and still
A time for dreams to weave their mystic will

The stars above, a twinkling show
A celestial tapestry, forever slow
Their gentle sparkle lights the darkest night
Guiding us through life's uncertain plight

In this quiet hour, our souls take flight
And in the darkness, we find new light
The world may be asleep, but not our heart
For in its depths, a spark of love will start

And when the dawn breaks, and morning's hue
Awakens all, both old and new.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
