 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, with clasps so tight,
Holds secrets deep within its sight.
Documents and dreams reside,
In papers filed, neatly tied.
A symbol of ambition's stride,
Across the boardroom, side by side.
It journeys forth, a silent guide,
With destinies it can't hide. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  

Let me know if I can create anything else for you. ğŸ˜Š
