A mountain of refuse, a plastic sea,
Leftovers, wrappers, and things meant to be.
From food we devoured to toys long since played,
Garbage accumulates, a future betrayed.
Mountains grow taller, oceans choked tight,
A silent reminder of our wasteful plight.
We must mend our ways, recycle with care,
Lest this trashy burden become beyond compare.
