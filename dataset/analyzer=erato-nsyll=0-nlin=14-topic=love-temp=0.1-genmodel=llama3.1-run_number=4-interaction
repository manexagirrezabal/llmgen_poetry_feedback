 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
It's a bond between two souls, so strong and free,
A connection that's meant to be.

With every kiss, with every tender care,
Love grows and flourishes, beyond compare.
It's the whispered words in the dead of night,
The laughter shared, the tears held tight.

In love's pure light, all else fades away,
Leaving only the beauty of each new day.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that captures the essence of love for you. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
