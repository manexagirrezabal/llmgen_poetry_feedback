In silicon halls, it stands so tall,
A hub of connectivity for one and all.
The router's might, it manages with ease,
Directing packets to their designated peace.

Its LEDs glow bright, a gentle hue,
As data flows through, both old and new.
It's the unsung hero, often unseen,
Keeping networks up, as smooth as a dream.

With wireless waves, it reaches far and wide,
Connecting devices, side by side.
A steadfast guardian of our digital space,
Protecting against threats with its steady pace.

Through wires and air, it routes the way,
For information to flow every day.
