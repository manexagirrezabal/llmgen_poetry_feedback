In hidden corners, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It routes and directs, with speed and with care
Connecting devices, without a single snare
Its LED lights glow, like tiny eyes in the night
As it works tirelessly, to keep our internet bright
A humble hero, often overlooked in sight
