 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark wings come to stay
A whispered sigh, a final breath
And mortal life is lost in death

The heart that beat with love and fire
Now still and cold as darkest mire
The eyes that shone like stars above
Grow dim and dark, a fleeting love

 Memories linger, bittersweet
Of laughter, tears, and moments sweet
But death's dark veil, it gently falls
And all is lost in eternal halls

In silence, darkness claims its own
And mortal life is but a memory gone
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
