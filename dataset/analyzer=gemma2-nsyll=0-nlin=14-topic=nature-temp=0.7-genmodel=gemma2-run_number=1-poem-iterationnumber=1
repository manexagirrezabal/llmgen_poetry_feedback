Sunlight streams through leaves of jade and gold,
Painting dappled patterns on the mossy ground.
A robin sings a melody untold,
While butterflies in colors swirl around.

The whispering wind through tall grass gently weaves,
A symphony of rustling, soft and low.
A silver stream, where ancient willow grieves,
Reflects the sky, a canvas aglow.

Nature's embrace, a haven sweet and calm,
Where worries fade and spirits find release.
In every leaf, a silent, whispered psalm,
A testament to beauty, born of peace.

So let us pause, and breathe the air so clean,
And feel the pulse of life, serene.
