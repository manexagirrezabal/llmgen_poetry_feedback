The old oak stands, a sentinel of time,
Its branches reaching, etched against the sky sublime.
Leaves dance and whisper secrets in the breeze,
A symphony of rustling, through the ancient trees.

Sunlight filters, dappled on the ground,
Where shadows stretch and twist, without a sound.
Birdsong fills the air, a sweet refrain,
As nature's tapestry unfolds again.

The scent of earth, a grounding, earthy smell,
A reminder of life's stories, it can tell.
Time moves slowly here, in this tranquil space,
Where worries fade and find their rightful place.

So breathe it in, this moment calm and bright,
And let the oak's wisdom fill you with its light.
