The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A dimming light, where once a flame did start.
No more the pulse, the beating of the heart,
Just silent stillness, playing its own part.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ended, put to life's behest.
But memories bloom, like flowers in the sun,
And love endures, though flesh and bone are gone.

Through misty veils, a spirit takes its flight,
To realms unseen, bathed in ethereal light.
The cycle turns, from birth to fading grace,
A timeless dance, in life's unending space.

So let us mourn not, but celebrate the soul,
That touched our lives, and made us truly whole.
