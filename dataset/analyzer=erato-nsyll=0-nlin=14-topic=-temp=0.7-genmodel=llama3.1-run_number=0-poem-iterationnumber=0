Silent moonbeams dance upon the sea
A midnight sky of stars twinkling free
The waves caress the sandy shore so fine
As night's sweet peace descends in gentle design

The world is hushed, a quiet calm has come
The wind whispers secrets to the trees as one
Their branches sway in harmony above
A soothing melody of peaceful, endless love

In this still hour, my heart finds its rest
Free from the worries that trouble me at best
My soul is filled with tranquility and light
As I surrender to the beauty of this night

The world may be loud, but here it's serene
And in this peace, my spirit is made clean.
