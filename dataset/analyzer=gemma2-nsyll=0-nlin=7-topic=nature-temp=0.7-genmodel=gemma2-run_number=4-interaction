 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Sunlight dances on emerald leaves,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets through trees.
Birdsong fills the air, a sweet refrain,
While wildflowers bloom in vibrant array.
Crystal streams meander, clear and bright,
Nature's canvas, a breathtaking sight,
Harmony unfolds in day and night. 



 > human: Thank you!
