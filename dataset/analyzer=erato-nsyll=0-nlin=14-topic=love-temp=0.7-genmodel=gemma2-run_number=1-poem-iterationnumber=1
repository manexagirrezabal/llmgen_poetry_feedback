A whispered word, a gentle touch,
A spark ignites, loving so much.
Two hearts entwined, a rhythm shared,
Secrets spoken, softly declared.

Through sunlit days and starry nights,
Love's tender glow, ever so bright.
Hand in hand, we walk as one,
Our journey shared, beneath the sun.

With every smile, a world anew,
In love's embrace, dreams come true.
No distance vast, no time can tear,
This bond we hold, beyond compare.
A symphony of souls, eternally free.
