 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Silent whispers in the dark of night
A gentle breeze that signals the end of light
The final breath, a fleeting sigh
As life's last spark fades from mortal eye

In darkness lies the unknown sea
Where shadows wait to claim humanity
Eternal rest, a peaceful shore
Where souls depart, forever more
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
