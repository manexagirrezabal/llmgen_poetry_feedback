 > assistant: The moonbeams dance on silver streams,
A symphony of hushed and gentle dreams.
Stars like diamonds, scattered bright,
Illuminate the velvet night.
A whisper rustles through the trees,
Carrying secrets on the breeze.
Silence reigns, a sacred space,
Where weary souls find peace and grace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?
