 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
The router hums, connecting us all.
Through wires and waves, it weaves a web,
Of data streams, where thoughts are shed.
From distant lands to screens so bright,
It bridges gaps with digital light.
A modern marvel, unseen but key. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
