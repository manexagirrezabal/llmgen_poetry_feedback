 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and guiding through the night.
It's a gentle touch that soothes the soul,
A feeling that makes us whole.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! If you'd like, I can generate another poem on a different topic or create one with 4 lines about love again if you'd like something similar. Just let me know!
