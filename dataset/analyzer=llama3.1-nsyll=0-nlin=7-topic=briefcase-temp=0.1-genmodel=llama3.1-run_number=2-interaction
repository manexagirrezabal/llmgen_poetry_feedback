 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents for all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the weight of business inside.
It travels far, through city streets and night,
A symbol of success, a beacon in sight.
Its contents hidden, yet its value is bright.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
