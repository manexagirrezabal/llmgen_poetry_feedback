 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more applause, no laughter fills the air,
Just stillness deep, a weight beyond compare.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ends, a soul forever blessed.
But memories remain, like embers bright,
That flicker softly in the fading light.

Though tears may fall, and hearts may ache with pain,
Love's gentle touch will ease the mournful strain.
For death is not an ending, but a door,
That leads to realms we cannot yet explore.

And though we grieve, let hope our spirits guide,
To meet again, on that celestial tide. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 14 lines, it has 16 lines. Can you create a poem with 14 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh departs,
A silent curtain falls upon our hearts.
No more the laughter, joy, or sorrow's sting,
Just empty echoes where life used to sing.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey ends, a soul forever blessed.
But memories remain, like stars above,
To guide us through the darkness, and with love.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud our sight,
Hope's gentle beacon shines throughout the night.
For death is not an ending, but a start,
A passage to a realm beyond our art.

And in that place, where shadows gently fade,
We'll meet again, no longer sad or frayed.
