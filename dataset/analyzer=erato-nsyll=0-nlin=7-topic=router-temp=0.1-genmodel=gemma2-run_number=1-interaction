 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of wires, humming low,
Connecting worlds, to and fro.
Packets dance, a digital stream,
Through ethernet's woven dream.
From phone to screen, a silent guide,
The router stands, with steady stride.
Our online lives, it does preside. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
