 > assistant: A spark ignites, a flame begins to grow,
Two souls entwined, a bond that none can know.
Laughter shared, secrets whispered in the night,
Eyes that meet, reflecting purest light.

A gentle touch, a warmth that fills the air,
A silent promise, love beyond compare.
Through storms and sunshine, hand in hand they stand,
Two hearts united, forever in this land.

No words can capture, the depth of their embrace,
A timeless journey, etched upon each face.
Love's melody, a symphony so sweet,
A tapestry woven, where destinies meet.

Forever bound, by an unbreakable tie,
In love's embrace, they soar to endless sky. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
