The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
While whispering leaves dance in the gentle breeze,
And shadows lengthen, secrets they declare.

A silver moon ascends, a watchful eye,
Upon the sleeping world, serene and deep,
Stars like diamonds scattered in the sky,
Their silent vigil while the night does creep.

The scent of pine and damp earth fills the soul,
A tapestry of wonder, rich and vast,
From towering trees to dewdrops on a mole,
Nature's embrace, forever meant to last.

So breathe it in, this beauty all around,
And let your spirit in its peace be found.
