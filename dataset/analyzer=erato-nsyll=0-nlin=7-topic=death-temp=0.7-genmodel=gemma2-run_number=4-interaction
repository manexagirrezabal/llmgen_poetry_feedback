 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain, softly drawn,
Across a stage where life once shone.
The final act, the fading light,
A whispered sigh, into the night.
No more to dance, no more to sing,
Just memories that gently cling.
And peace descends, on weary wings. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.
