A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
It weaves a web where data flows and sleeps.
Packets race through wires, swift and unseen,
Connecting worlds, both distant and between.

From laptop screens to phones held in our hand,
It grants us access, at our command.
A silent guardian, ever watching near,
Ensuring signals travel clear and dear.

The router stands, a sentinel of light,
Guiding information through the digital night.
A humble hero, often overlooked, yet true,
It binds us all, in shades of blue.
 
No longer bound by distance, we can roam,
Thanks to the router, bringing us back home.
