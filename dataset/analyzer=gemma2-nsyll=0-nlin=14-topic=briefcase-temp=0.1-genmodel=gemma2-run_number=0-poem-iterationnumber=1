Leather bound and sturdy strong,
A briefcase holds ambitions long.
Within its depths, a world unfolds,
Of meetings, deals, and stories told.

From boardroom battles to coffee's steam,
It carries dreams, a hopeful gleam.
The click of latches, a steady beat,
As plans are made, and futures meet.

A silent witness to triumphs won,
And losses felt beneath the sun.
A symbol etched in time's embrace,
Of journeys taken, at a hurried pace.

So raise a glass to this trusty guide,
The briefcase by our side.
