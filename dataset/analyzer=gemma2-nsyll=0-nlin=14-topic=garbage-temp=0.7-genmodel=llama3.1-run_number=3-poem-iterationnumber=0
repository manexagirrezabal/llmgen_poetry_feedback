In streets and alleys, it's a common sight
A mountain of trash, a dismal plight
Food wrappers and bottles, discarded with ease
A careless attitude, a world to please

The landfills grow, a growing concern
Pollution and waste, a never-ending trend
We throw away things, without a second thought
Leaving behind a legacy we've brought

But what does it say about us as a whole?
That we value convenience over our soul?
We're drowning in waste, with no end in sight
A reflection of our habits, day and night

Let's change our ways, let's reduce and reuse
For the future of our planet, we must all produce
