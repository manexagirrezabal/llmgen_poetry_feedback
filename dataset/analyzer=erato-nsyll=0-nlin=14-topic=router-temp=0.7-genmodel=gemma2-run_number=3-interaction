 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, its domain serene.
Through plastic shell, a pulse begins to flow,
Connecting worlds, both near and far below.

Packets dance, across the ether's stream,
A symphony of bits, a digital dream.
From distant lands, to screens that brightly glow,
Information flows, where knowledge can grow.

With steady hum, it guards the network's core,
Directing traffic, to each open door.
A guardian angel, in the tech-filled night,
Guiding our steps, with digital light.

So raise a glass, to this humble device,
The router's magic, keeps our world alive. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  😊  Let me know if you have any other creative requests! 💻✍️💡
