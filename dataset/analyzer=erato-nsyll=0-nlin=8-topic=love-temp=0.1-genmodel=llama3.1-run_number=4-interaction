 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and lighting up the night.
It's a feeling that can't be tamed or told,
A gentle touch that makes the soul unfold.

In its presence, fears and doubts subside,
And all that's left is a love that won't divide.
With every beat of the heart, it grows strong,
Forever changing lives with a love so long.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
