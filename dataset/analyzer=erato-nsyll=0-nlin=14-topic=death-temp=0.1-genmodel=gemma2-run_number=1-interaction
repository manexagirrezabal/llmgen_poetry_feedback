 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just empty echoes in the twilight dews.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A life once lived, now memories unfold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where spirits gently glide?
Or is it darkness, endless and profound?
No mortal tongue can truly speak the sound.

But in the silence, peace begins to bloom,
A quiet solace in the shadowed room. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
