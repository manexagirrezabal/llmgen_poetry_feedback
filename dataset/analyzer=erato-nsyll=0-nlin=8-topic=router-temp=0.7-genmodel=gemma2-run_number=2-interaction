 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent box, with blinking light,
It weaves a web, both day and night.
Packets flow, through unseen streams,
Connecting worlds, fulfilling dreams.
From distant shores to screens nearby,
Information dances, swift and high.
The router's hum, a steady beat,
Keeps us connected, oh so sweet. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š  </div> <div style="text-align:center">
