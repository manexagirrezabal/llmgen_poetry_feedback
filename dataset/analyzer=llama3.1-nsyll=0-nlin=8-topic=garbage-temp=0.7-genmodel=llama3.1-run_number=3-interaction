 > assistant: In the streets, it piles so high
A mountain of waste, passing by
Plastic and paper, discarded with care

As humans recklessly contribute to its stain
The once blue skies are now gray and old
A reflection of the garbage we're told
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
