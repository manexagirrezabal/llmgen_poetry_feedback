In alleys dark and streets so wide,
A mountain high of trash resides.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A sea of waste, what are we to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away with reckless flow.
Food wrappers, cans, and cardboard stacks,
A never-ending pile that's hard to pack.

The air is thick with fumes so bad,
From rotting trash that's left unmad.
The ground beneath begins to crack,
As waste accumulates with no looking back.

We must take care, it's time to see,
The harm we cause and set our planet free.
