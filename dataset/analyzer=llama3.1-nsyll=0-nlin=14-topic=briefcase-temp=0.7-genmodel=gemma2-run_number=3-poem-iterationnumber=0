A sturdy shell, of leather brown or black,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily tasks.
Within its depths, ambitions lie in track,
And plans unfold like maps with winding asks.

From boardroom meetings to bustling city streets,
The briefcase trots, a silent, steadfast friend.
Its clasp secures the secrets that it keeps,
A vessel where success can rise and mend.

But more than just a tool for work's demands,
It speaks of journeys taken, goals attained.
A symbol etched in life's outstretched hands,
Of progress made, and battles bravely gained.

So raise a toast to this unassuming friend,
The briefcase holds the power that will mend.
