The old oak stands, a sentinel of time,
Its branches reaching, like fingers to climb.
Through sun and storm, it's weathered every year,
A silent witness, holding stories dear.

Leaves dance in whispers, rustling in the breeze,
Sunlight filters through, casting dappled trees.
Birds build their nests, high in its embrace,
Finding shelter, a safe and tranquil space.

Roots run deep, anchoring it to earth,
A symbol of strength, enduring from birth.
Seasons change, but the oak remains so bold,
A timeless beauty, a story to be told.

And as twilight falls, it casts a gentle shade,
A guardian of wisdom, forever unafraid.
