Moonlight whispers secrets bright
A midnight sky with stars in sight
The world is hushed, a peaceful place
Where shadows dance and darkness fills the space
The wind it howls like a lonely sigh
As trees sway gently, their leaves on high
In this still hour, I find my peace
And let the world's wild beauty release
