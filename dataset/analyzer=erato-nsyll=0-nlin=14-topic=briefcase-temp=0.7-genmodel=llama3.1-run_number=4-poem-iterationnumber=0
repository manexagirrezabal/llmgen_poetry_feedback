A briefcase sits on the floor so fine,
Its leather worn, its stories divine.
It holds the weight of daily strife,
And papers that bind our working life.

Its metal clasps hold things in place,
As we stuff it full with a hectic pace.
In morning's rush, it's by our side,
A constant companion, never to subside.

It carries our dreams and daily fears,
And whispers secrets through the years.
Through meetings and deals, it holds its ground,
And bears the weight of our professional round.

Its contents are vast, yet so confined,
A symbol of work that we cannot leave behind.
