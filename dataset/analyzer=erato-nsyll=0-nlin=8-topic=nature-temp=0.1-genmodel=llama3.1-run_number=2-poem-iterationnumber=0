The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Dancing in the breeze with gentle might.

The river flows with waters deep,
Reflecting beauty in its quiet sleep.
The mountains rise with peaks so high,
A majestic sight that touches the sky.
