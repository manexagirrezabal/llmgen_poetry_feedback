A silent sentinel, a box of might,
The router hums, both day and darkest night.
It speaks in packets, data's fleeting dance,
Connecting worlds, a digital expanse.

From laptops sleek to phones held in our hand,
It weaves a web across the shifting sand.
No hero's cape, no fanfare or acclaim,
Yet vital threads it weaves within its frame.

A symphony of bits, a constant flow,
Guiding information, helping knowledge grow.
So raise a glass to this humble, unseen friend,
Whose tireless work connects us without end.
