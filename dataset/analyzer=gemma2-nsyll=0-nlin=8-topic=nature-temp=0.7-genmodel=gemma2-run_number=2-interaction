 > assistant: The sunbeams dance on leaves so green,
A gentle breeze whispers through the scene.
Flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
Nature's beauty, a wondrous muse.

Birds sing sweetly in the trees,
While squirrels scamper with joyful ease.
A babbling brook flows clear and bright,
Nature's symphony, a pure delight.
