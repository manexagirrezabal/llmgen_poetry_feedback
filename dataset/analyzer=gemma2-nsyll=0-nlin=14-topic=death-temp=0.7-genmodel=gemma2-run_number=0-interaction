 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh,
A curtain falls, the world goes by.
No more the sun's warm, golden rays,
No laughter rings through earthly days.
A silent sleep, a peaceful rest,
Where memories linger, truly blessed.
Though sorrow lingers, grief takes hold,
Love's ember shines, a story told.
In realms unseen, beyond our sight,
A journey starts, into the night.
Stars may gleam, and angels sing,
As souls take flight on feathered wing.
Death's gentle touch, a mystery,
A timeless dance of you and me. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š
