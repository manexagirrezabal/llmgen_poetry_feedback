 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent whisper, a fading light,
The curtain falls on day and night.
A final breath, a whispered sigh,
As stars ignite in a velvet sky.
No longer bound by earthly chains,
The soul departs, beyond life's lanes.
In memory's embrace, we hold them dear,
Though death draws near, their love is clear. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad you liked the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests.
