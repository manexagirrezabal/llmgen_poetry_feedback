 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A symbol of power, a tool of might
The briefcase sits, a constant sight
Leather-bound and sturdy as can be
A holder of secrets, for you and me

It carries papers, files, and more
The weight of responsibility in store
A daily companion, through work and play
A trusted friend, that never strays

In meetings and conferences, it's by your side
A confident presence, with documents to abide
It holds the keys, to success and fame
And keeps your thoughts, in a well-organized frame

With every step, it stays right behind
A faithful ally, through work's busy grind
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that met your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
