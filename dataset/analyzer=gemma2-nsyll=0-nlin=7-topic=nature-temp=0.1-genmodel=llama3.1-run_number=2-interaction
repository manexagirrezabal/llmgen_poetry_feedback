 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze stirs wildflowers in glee.
The river flows, its waters calm and deep,
Reflecting mountains that in silence sleep.
Nature's beauty is a peaceful sight to keep.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
