 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The final curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
A silent hush descends, a somber mark.
The fleeting breath, a whisper on the breeze,
Escapes the mortal coil, finds final ease.

No more the laughter, tears, or earthly strife,
Just empty echoes in the halls of life.
A tapestry unwoven, threads unwind,
Leaving behind a void we cannot bind.

But memories linger, like embers glow,
And love's warm touch, forever seems to flow.
Though bodies fade and spirits take their flight,
The essence lingers, bathed in eternal light.

Death's icy grip may claim the mortal shell,
But souls transcend, where stories ever dwell.
