 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
As shadows lengthen 'neath a fading sky.
The body sleeps, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing,
In hearts that hold the love forever flowing.
And though the form departs, the spirit flies,
To realms unknown, beneath celestial skies.

So let us grieve not, for death's embrace is kind,
A peaceful slumber, leaving naught behind.

 > assistant: The final breath, a whispered sigh escapes,
A dimming light, where life's bright flame drapes.
No more the pulse, the heartbeat's steady drum,
Just silence reigns, where echoes softly hum.

The body rests, a vessel laid to sleep,
While memories dance, secrets they will keep.
A tapestry of moments, woven fine,
Now fades to gray, a design left behind.

But love endures, a beacon in the night,
Guiding souls through darkness, shining bright.
And though we mourn, let hope's sweet solace bloom,
For life transcends this earthly, shadowed room.

In realms unseen, where spirits gently roam,
We find our peace, and make our final home.

A silent hush where laughter once had spun.
No vibrant hues, no beating heart's refrain,
Just empty space where life had held its reign.

The body sleeps, a journey now complete,
A whispered sigh, a soul set gently free.
But memories linger, like stars in night,
Guiding our steps, a beacon burning bright.

Though tears may fall, and grief may cloud the day,
Love's gentle hand will lead us on our way.
For death is not an end, but just a door,
To realms unknown, where spirits soar.

And though we part, our souls will ever meet,
In timeless love, forever bittersweet.
