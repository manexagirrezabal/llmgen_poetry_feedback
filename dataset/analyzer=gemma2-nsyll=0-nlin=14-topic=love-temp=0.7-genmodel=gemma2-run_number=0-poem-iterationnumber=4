A whispered word, a gentle touch takes hold,
Two hearts entwined, a story to be told.
In love's soft embrace, a flame ignites so bright,
Guiding our path through darkest night.

Through laughter shared and tears that gently fall,
Love's tender presence conquers one and all.
A bond unbreakable, a sacred trust we keep,
Forever bound in dreams, while shadows sleep.

With every glance, a promise softly made,
Two souls united, destinies unweighed.
In love's sweet haven, hearts find their way home,
A symphony of passion, beautifully shown.
