 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming our hearts with its gentle light.
It's the whispered words in the dead of night,
The tender touch that sets our souls alight.
It's the laughter we share, the tears we dry,
A bond between two hearts that never says goodbye.
In love's sweet refuge, we find our home.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I hope you enjoy the poem! If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
