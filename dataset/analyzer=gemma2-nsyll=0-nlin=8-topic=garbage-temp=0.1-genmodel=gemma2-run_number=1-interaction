 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic sea, a paper tide,
Where cans and bottles softly glide.
Forgotten wrappers, dreams decayed,
A silent story, slowly made.
The earth groans under weight unseen,
A tapestry of waste, obscene.
Oh, heed the call, let's turn the tide,
And leave a world where beauty can reside. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests.  âœ¨
