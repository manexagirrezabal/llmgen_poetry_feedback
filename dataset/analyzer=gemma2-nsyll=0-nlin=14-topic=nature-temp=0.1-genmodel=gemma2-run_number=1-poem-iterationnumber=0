The sun dips low, paints clouds with fiery hues,
A symphony of birdsong fills the air,
Green leaves whisper secrets as the breeze pursues,
And wildflowers dance in sunlight's golden snare.

A babbling brook sings softly through the trees,
Reflecting azure skies and mirrored grace,
While butterflies on painted wings appease,
Their thirst for nectar in a sunlit space.

The scent of pine and earth, a fragrant blend,
Invites the soul to wander, free and light,
Where nature's beauty knows no end,
And worries fade into the fading night.

A tapestry of wonder, rich and deep,
Nature's embrace, where dreams and secrets sleep.
