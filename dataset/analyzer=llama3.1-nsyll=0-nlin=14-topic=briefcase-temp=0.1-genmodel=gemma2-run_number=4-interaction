 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and daily grind.
Within its depths, ambitions can be found,
And secrets whispered, left behind.

From boardroom meetings to coffee shop chats,
It travels with its owner, step by stride.
A silent witness to triumphs and defeats,
A constant companion on life's long ride.

Its clasp clicks shut, a promise kept secure,
Of plans and projects, carefully concealed.
A symbol of ambition, ever pure,
A vessel for the future, yet revealed.

So raise a glass to this humble case,
A faithful friend in time and every place. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
