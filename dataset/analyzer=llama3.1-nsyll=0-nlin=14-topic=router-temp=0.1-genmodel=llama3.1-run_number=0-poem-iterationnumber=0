In silicon halls, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
The router's gentle hum, a soothing sound
As data flows through, without a bound

Its antennas reach, like outstretched hands
Receiving and sending, across the lands
It navigates the web, with ease and speed
Connecting devices, in a digital creed

With Wi-Fi waves, it casts its net wide
A beacon of access, for all to reside
In homes and offices, it's a constant friend
Guiding us through, till the very end

Through routers' eyes, our world is made new
A realm of information, forever true
