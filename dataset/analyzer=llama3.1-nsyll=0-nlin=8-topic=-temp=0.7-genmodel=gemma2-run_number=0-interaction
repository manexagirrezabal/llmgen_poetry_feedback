 > assistant: The wind whispers secrets through leaves of jade,
Sunlight paints gold on a path untamed.
A lone bird sings, its melody swayed,
By breezes that dance and softly proclaimed.
A babbling brook, a crystal clear stream,
Reflects azure skies, a tranquil dream.
Nature's embrace, a gentle refrain,
Whispers peace where worries can't reign. 



 > human: Thank you!
