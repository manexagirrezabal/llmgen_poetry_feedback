A silent sentinel, it sits and waits,
A network's heart, sealing digital fates.
Packets flow through its intricate design,
Connecting worlds, a web both yours and mine.
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam,
The router hums, a whispered cyber dream.
A bridge of bits, where information streams.
