 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 4 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Two souls entwined, a whispered plea,
A gentle touch, a symphony.
In hearts that beat as one they find,
Love's timeless grace, forever kind.  



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps another poem on a different topic?  âœ¨
