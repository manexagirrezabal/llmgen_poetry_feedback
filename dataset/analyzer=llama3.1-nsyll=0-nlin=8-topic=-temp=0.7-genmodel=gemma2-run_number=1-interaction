 > assistant: The moon hangs heavy, a silver tear,
Upon a velvet canvas dark and clear.
Stars whisper secrets, soft and low,
As shadows dance, where breezes flow.

A lonely owl calls, a mournful sound,
While crickets chirp, on hallowed ground.
The night unfolds, a mystic dream,
Where slumber reigns, and spirits gleam. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem. ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other requests. âœ¨
