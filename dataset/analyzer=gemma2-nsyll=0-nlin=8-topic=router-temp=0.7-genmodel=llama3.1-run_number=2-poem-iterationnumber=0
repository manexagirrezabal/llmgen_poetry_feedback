In hidden spaces, it quietly resides
A hub of connection, where signals abide
It receives and forwards, with calculated pace
A constant presence, in our digital space

With Wi-Fi waves, it radiates its might
Allowing devices to join in its sight
It routes the traffic, with efficient care
Keeping our online world, connected and fair
