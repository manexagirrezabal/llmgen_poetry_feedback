A heart beats fast, a whispered name,
Love's gentle touch, an ardent flame.
Two souls connect, destinies entwined,
A journey shared, forever enshrined.

Eyes that sparkle, holding worlds untold,
Stories whispered, dreams unfold.
Laughter dances, light and free,
A symphony of love, for all to see.

Through stormy seas and skies so bright,
Their love a beacon, shining light.
Hand in hand, they face the day,
Love's guiding star, forever their way.
