The twilight sky, a canvas vast and wide,
With hues of orange, purple, side by side.
A gentle breeze caresses fields of gold,
As stories whispered, centuries old.

The sun descends, a fiery ball ablaze,
Casting long shadows in a golden haze.
Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Their distant light, a journey just begun.

The moon ascends, a silver orb so bright,
Guiding lost souls through the silent night.
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
As nature slumbers, free from earthly care.

Peace descends, a blanket soft and deep,
While dreams take flight, and secrets softly sleep.
