Sunlight paints the leaves in hues of gold,
A gentle breeze through branches softly flows.
Wildflowers bloom, a vibrant tapestry,
Butterflies dance, a symphony for thee.

Crystal streams meander, clear and bright,
Reflecting skies of azure light.
Ancient trees stand tall, their roots run deep,
Secrets whispered while the world does sleep.

Crimson sunsets blaze across the sky,
As stars ignite, a celestial sigh.
Nature's canvas, ever-changing, bold,
A story whispered, never to grow old.
