 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.

A blight on cities all day long,
A problem that will not be gone.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
