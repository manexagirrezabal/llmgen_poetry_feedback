A sturdy shell of leather, worn and brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and deals unknown.
Within its depths, ambitions take their flight,
Contracts signed, futures bathed in golden light.

From boardroom walls to bustling city streets,
It walks with purpose, where ambition meets.
A silent witness to triumphs and despair,
The briefcase carries burdens, light or rare.

Each click of latch, a whispered promise made,
Of goals achieved, and fortunes to be laid.
A symbol of success, a tool of trade,
It journeys onward, never to be swayed.

A humble vessel, yet so full of might,
The briefcase holds the power of the night.
