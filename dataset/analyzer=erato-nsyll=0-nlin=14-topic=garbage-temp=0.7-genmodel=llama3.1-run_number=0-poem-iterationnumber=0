In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles high, side by side.
Food scraps rot, and broken things,
A mess that clings to everything.

Plastic bags are blown away,
And litter scatters, night and day.
The stench of waste assails the air,
A foul smell that's hard to bear.

Bottles and cans, a recyclable fate,
But often end up in this wretched state.
The earth groans under weight so great,
As garbage grows, an endless wait.

Human carelessness on full display,
A sorry sight, each and every day.
