 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Golden sunsets paint the sky,
Peaceful evening, twilight sigh.
The world is hushed in quiet sleep,
Stars appear, their vigil keep.
Night's soft darkness starts to creep,
A time for dreams, and memories deep.
In silence, all is made complete.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that meets your request. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
