 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
Shadows dance upon the wall tonight
The wind it howls like a restless sigh
As autumn leaves begin to say goodbye

Golden hues and crimson red
Fading light on winter's bed
 Memories of summer's warmth remain
Echoes of love that cannot be regained

Silent stars up in the sky
Reflecting dreams that pass us by
A midnight breeze that rustles through
The trees stand tall, their vigil true

In this quiet hour I find my peace
And a sense of calm, my soul releases.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
