 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Death's dark whisper comes to stay
A silent guest, with gentle hand

The heart that beats, now still and cold
 Memories linger, young and old
Eternal rest, for the soul.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
