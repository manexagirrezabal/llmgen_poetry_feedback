 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that brightly gleam.

It guides the flow, a traffic master bold,
Ensuring whispers travel, stories told.
Through networks vast, connections unfold,
The router hums, its magic takes hold. 



 > human: The poem doesn’t have 8 lines, it has 7 lines. Can you create a poem with 8 lines? Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A box of circuits, humming low and deep,
It weaves a web where data secrets keep.
From phone to screen, a silent symphony,
The router guides, for you and me.

Through tangled wires, signals take their flight,
Connecting lives both day and darkest night.
A digital bridge, unseen yet ever near,
The world unfolds, with every byte held dear. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I'm glad I could help craft a poem that met your needs. 😊  Let me know if you have any other creative writing requests! ✍️
