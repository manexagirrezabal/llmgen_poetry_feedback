 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A whisper soft, a touch so light,
Eyes that sparkle, burning bright.
Laughter shared, a gentle hand,
Two souls entwined, they understand.
A love that blooms, a tender grace,
Time stands still in this sacred space.
Forever bound, in love's embrace. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  ðŸ˜Š Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
