The sun dips low, a fiery kiss goodbye,
Painting the clouds with hues of gold and red.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves on high,
As twilight's veil begins to softly spread.

Stars emerge, like diamonds in the night,
Their distant glimmer fills the velvet sky.
An owl's soft hoot, a beacon burning bright,
As shadows lengthen, secrets start to fly.

The world grows still, a hush descends on all,
A moment caught between the day and dawn.
And in this peace, our weary spirits call,
For solace found, until the break of morn.


The moon ascends, a silver orb so grand,
Guiding dreams through slumber's mystic land.
