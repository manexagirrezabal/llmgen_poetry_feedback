 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds with data's swift machine.
Packets dance through wires, a digital stream,
From distant shores to screens that gleam.

It guides the flow, a tireless guide,
Through networks vast, where secrets hide.
A humble box, yet power it wields,
The router reigns, its magic revealed. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
