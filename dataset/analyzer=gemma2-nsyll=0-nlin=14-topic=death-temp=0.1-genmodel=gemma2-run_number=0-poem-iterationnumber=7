A final breath, a whisper on the breeze,
Life's vibrant tapestry begins to seize.
No more the laughter, tears that once did fall,
Just silent echoes in the empty hall.

A journey ends, a story left untold,
A tapestry of moments, now grown cold.
The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
While whispers dance upon the soul's behest.

Beyond the veil, what mysteries reside?
Do stars ignite where earthly spirits glide?
Or is it peace, a tranquil, endless night?
A question pondered in the fading light. 
Where shadows lengthen and the sun descends,
The soul embarks on journeys without ends.
