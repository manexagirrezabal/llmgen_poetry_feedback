A sleek and sturdy case of leather worn,
A symbol of success, or so it's sworn.
 Inside its depths, papers and files do lay,
Important documents, in a careful way.

It rides by one's side, with each busy stride,
A trusted companion, through work's tide.
Its metal clasps hold tight, with a reassuring sound,
A briefcase's purpose, is always to be found.
