The wind whispers secrets through leaves of gold,
Sunlight dances on a path yet untold.
Crimson and amber, the colors ignite,
As autumn's embrace paints the fading light.
A symphony of rustling, soft and low,
Where memories bloom and gently grow.
Winter slumber waits, but for now we see,
The beauty of change, wild and free.
