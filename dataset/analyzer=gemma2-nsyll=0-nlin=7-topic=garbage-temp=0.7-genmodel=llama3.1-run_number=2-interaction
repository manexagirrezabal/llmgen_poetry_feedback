 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Trash cans overflow with yesterday's waste
 Forgotten wrappers and crumpled paper to replace

A toxic legacy that will not subside
A world of waste, where earth's beauty has died
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about garbage for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
