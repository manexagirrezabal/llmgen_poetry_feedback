 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A plastic crown, a cardboard throne,
Where crumpled cans and wrappers moan.
A landfill's heart, a festering mound,
Of discarded dreams, no longer found.
The earth groans low beneath its weight,
A silent plea, before it's too late.
Let's mend our ways, recycle, create. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ğŸ˜Š
