 > assistant: In silicon halls, it sits so fine,
A router's heart, with wires entwined.
It guides the signals, fast and true,
Connecting all, for me and you.

With Wi-Fi waves, it spreads its might,
Reaching far, through day and night.
It routes the data, with speed and care,
 Ensuring connections, beyond compare.

In homes and offices, it's a common sight,
A necessary tool, in our digital light.
It keeps us connected, to the world outside,
A bridge of information, where we reside.

With its humming noise, it works behind the scenes,
Keeping our networks, in perfect streams.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
