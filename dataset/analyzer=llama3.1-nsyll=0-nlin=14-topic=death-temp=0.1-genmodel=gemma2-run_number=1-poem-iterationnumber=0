A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A gentle breeze through withered leaves does sigh,
As shadows lengthen 'neath a fading sky.
The body rests, its journey now complete,
A tapestry of moments, bittersweet.

But memories linger, like embers glowing,
In hearts that hold them, love forever flowing.
Though flesh may fade and bones return to dust,
The spirit soars, on wings of hope and trust.

And in the silence, whispers softly rise,
"Life's not an ending, but a sweet sunrise."
