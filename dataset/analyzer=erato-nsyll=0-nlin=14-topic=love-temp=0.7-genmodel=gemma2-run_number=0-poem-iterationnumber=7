A single glance, a spark ignites within,
Two souls collide, where love can truly begin.
Hearts beat as one, a rhythm soft and low,
Whispers of longing, secrets meant to grow.

With hands entwined, they walk through fields of gold,
Laughter echoes, stories yet untold.
Beneath the moonlit sky, stars softly gleam,
Reflecting love's bright flame, a shared dream.

Through life's adventures, hand in hand they stride,
Two hearts forever bound, side by side.
Love's tender touch, a solace ever true,
A tapestry woven, with threads of me and you.
