 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A leather shell, a metal clasp,
Holds secrets close, in shadows wrapped.
Within its depths, ambitions lie,
Deals struck and dreams that soar so high.
From boardroom walls to bustling streets,
It carries burdens, hopes, defeats.
A silent witness, ever near,
The briefcase whispers tales of fear. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
