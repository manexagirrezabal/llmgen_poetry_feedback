 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about death. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In darkness, death's cold hand does creep
A silent thief, in endless sleep
It takes our breath, and steals our sight
Leaving behind, an empty night
 Memories of life, a fading light
Echoes of what once was, lost in time
Forever gone, without a rhyme
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: If you need anything else, feel free to ask.
