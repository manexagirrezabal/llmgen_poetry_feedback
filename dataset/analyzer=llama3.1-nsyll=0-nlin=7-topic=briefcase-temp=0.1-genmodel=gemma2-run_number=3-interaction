 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds ambitions, hopes, and frown.
Within its depths, secrets reside,
Deals struck, dreams both far and wide.
A silent witness to each day,
The briefcase carries on its way,
A symbol of the work we do. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoyed the poem. ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
