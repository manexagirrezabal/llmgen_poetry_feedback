A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
Connecting worlds through wires and light keen.
Data flows like rivers, swift and strong,
Guiding packets where they belong.
From web to game, a constant hum,
It weaves a tapestry, connections come.
The router's heart, a tireless beat,
Sharing knowledge, making networks complete.
