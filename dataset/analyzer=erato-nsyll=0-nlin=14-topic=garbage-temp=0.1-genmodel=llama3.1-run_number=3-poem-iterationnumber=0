In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up, side by side.
Plastic bags and bottles too,
A waste of resources, what to do?

The earth cries out in pain and woe,
As humans throw away, don't know.
Food scraps rot, a stench so strong,
Polluting air, where does it belong?

In landfills deep, it's buried tight,
But toxins seep, a poisonous sight.
The ocean's waves, a garbage sea,
A reflection of humanity.

We must change our ways, it's time to see,
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, for you and me.
