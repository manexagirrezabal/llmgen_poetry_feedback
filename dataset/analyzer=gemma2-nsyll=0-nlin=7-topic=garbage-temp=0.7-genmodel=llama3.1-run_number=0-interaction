 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about garbage. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In alleys dark and streets so wide,
Garbage piles up with no place to reside.
Plastic bags and cans, a messy sight,
Discarded waste, a blight on our night.
The earth cries out for a cleaner way,
To reduce, reuse, and recycle each day.
Let's keep our world from garbage's sway.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could help create a poem about a timely topic like waste management. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
