Trash-filled streets, a sorry sight
Wealth discarded, without a fight
Plastic bags, like ghosts, they remain
Forgotten dreams, in a waste-filled terrain

The stench of rot, a putrid smell
A reflection of our actions' tell
Cans and bottles, a cluttered mess
A byproduct of our excess

The earth cries out, with pain and woe
As garbage piles high, don't you know?
Our consumption habits, a heavy toll
On the planet's health, we're told

Let's reduce, reuse, recycle too
For a cleaner world, there's still something new
And a chance to make amends, for me and you.
