A tide of plastic, bottles twist and sway,
Where broken cans lament a bygone day.
Forgotten snacks, in wrappers cast away,
A silent testament to what we've made.

The stench of rot, a symphony of waste,
Where nature's balance struggles to hold fast.
Landfills grow, a monument to haste,
A somber shadow on this earth amassed.

But even here, a resilient shoot appears,
Amidst the refuse, quelling all our fears.
A fragile hope, dispelling doubt and tears,
To mend our ways, and conquer waste's snares.
