 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, it stands unseen,
A web of wires, a digital dream.
It speaks in packets, a language unknown,
Connecting worlds, making data flown.

From distant servers to your eager screen,
It weaves a tapestry, vibrant and keen.
A gateway to knowledge, a portal to play,
It guides your journey, come what may.

But when it falters, the world slows its pace,
Frustration mounts, a digital disgrace.
A blinking light, a signal so weak,
The internet's lifeline, now hard to seek.

Yet with a reboot, or a simple tweak,
It springs back to life, connections unique. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  Let me know if you have any other creative requests. ğŸ˜Š
