 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: In hidden corners, it's placed with care
A tiny box that connects us all there
The router buzzes, humming with might
Bringing internet to our daily sight

It routes and directs with digital ease
Allowing devices to communicate and please
With wireless signals that reach far and wide
 Connecting us online, side by side.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem about routers to your request. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
