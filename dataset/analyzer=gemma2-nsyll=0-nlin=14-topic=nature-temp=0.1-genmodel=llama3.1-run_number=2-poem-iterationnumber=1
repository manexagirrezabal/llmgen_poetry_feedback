The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Reflecting beauty in its peaceful dream.
The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks touching clouds in morning light.

The forest floor, a carpet green and deep,
Where wildflowers bloom and creatures creep.
The scent of pine and earth fills the air,
Invigorating senses beyond compare.

In nature's arms, I find my peace.
