A single touch, a spark that sets aflame,
Two hearts entwined, whispering love's sweet name.
In gentle smiles and stolen glances bright,
Love's melody unfolds, both pure and light.

Through fields of dreams, they wander hand in hand,
Their destinies aligned, forever grand.
With whispered words, their souls begin to soar,
United by love, forevermore.

A tapestry woven with threads of gold,
Two lives entwined, a story to be told.
In love's embrace, they find solace and grace,
A timeless bond, etched upon time and space.
