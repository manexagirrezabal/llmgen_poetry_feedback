A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

The body sleeps, a vessel laid to rest,
A journey's end, a soul forever blessed.
But memories linger, echoes in the mind,
Of love and loss, of joys we left behind.

Though darkness claims us, fear not the unknown,
For in that silence, seeds of spirit sown.
A new beginning, whispered on the breeze,
Beyond the veil, where souls find sweet release.

And though we part, our essence will remain,
In every heartbeat, love's eternal flame.
