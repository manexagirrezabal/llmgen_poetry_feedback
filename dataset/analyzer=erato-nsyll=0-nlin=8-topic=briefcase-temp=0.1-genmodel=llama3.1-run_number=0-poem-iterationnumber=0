A sleek and sturdy briefcase stands tall,
Carrying secrets, documents for all.
Its leather exterior, worn with pride,
Conceals the contents, side by side.

Inside its depths, a world is stored,
Papers and files, carefully explored.
The weight of responsibility it bears,
A trusted companion through busy days and cares.
