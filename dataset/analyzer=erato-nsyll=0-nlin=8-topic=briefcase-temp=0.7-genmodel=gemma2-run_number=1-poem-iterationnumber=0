A sentinel of leather, sleek and brown,
It holds the secrets whispered in a town.
Deals struck, dreams spun, ambitions vast,
Within its clasp, futures come to pass.
From boardroom battles to coffee's steam,
It walks beside, a silent, constant stream.
A symbol weighty, filled with hopes and fears,
The briefcase journeys, through passing years.
