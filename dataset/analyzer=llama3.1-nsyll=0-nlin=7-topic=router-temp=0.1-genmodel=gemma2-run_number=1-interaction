 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about router. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A silent sentinel, unseen and small,
It weaves a web, connecting one and all.
Packets dance, through wires they do fly,
From distant screens to yours, it lets them sigh.
A gateway to worlds, both near and far,
The router hums, a constant guiding star.
Connecting lives, in its digital sphere. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
