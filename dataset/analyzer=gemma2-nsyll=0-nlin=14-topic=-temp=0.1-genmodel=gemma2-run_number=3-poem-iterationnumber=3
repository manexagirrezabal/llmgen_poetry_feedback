The twilight sky, a canvas painted gold,
With streaks of crimson, stories yet untold.
A gentle breeze whispers through leaves so green,
As day surrenders, and shadows convene.

The sun descends, a fiery ball ablaze,
Casting long shadows in a golden haze.
Stars begin to glimmer, one by one,
Their distant light, a journey just begun.

The moon ascends, a silver orb on high,
Guiding lost souls beneath the velvet sky.
A symphony of crickets fills the air,
As nature slumbers, free from earthly care.
