 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about nature. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall with leaves so bright,
Their gentle sway a peaceful sight.

The river flows with waters cold,
Its melody a story to be told.
The mountains rise with peaks so high,
A majestic beauty passing by.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create a poem that you enjoyed. If you have any other requests or need anything else, feel free to ask!
