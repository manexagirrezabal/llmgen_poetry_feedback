A briefcase bound in leather, dark and deep,
Holds secrets whispered, dreams that strive to leap.
Through cityscapes and boardrooms, it will tread,
A silent witness, where ambitions spread.

Each click a promise, deals both made and lost,
In corridors of power, at what a cost?
But when the day is done, and shadows fall,
It speaks in murmurs, tales beyond recall.

Of triumphs won and battles fiercely fought,
Of futures bright, and lessons dearly bought.
A weathered friend, through life's relentless chase,
The briefcase stands, with strength and quiet grace.
