 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Moonlight whispers secrets bright
Dance of shadows on the wall tonight
A midnight breeze that stirs and sighs
Echoes of memories that never die

The stars above a twinkling sea
Reflecting dreams that long to be free
In this quiet hour I find my peace
And in its stillness, love release
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: I'm glad I could create something for you. If you'd like another poem or have any specific requests, feel free to ask!
