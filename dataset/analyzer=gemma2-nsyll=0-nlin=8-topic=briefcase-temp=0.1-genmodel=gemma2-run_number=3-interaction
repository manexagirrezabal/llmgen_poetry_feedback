 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 8 lines about briefcase. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A sturdy shell of leather brown,
It holds the weight of dreams and town.
Within its clasp, a world unfolds,
Of meetings planned, and stories told.
From boardroom bright to coffee shop,
It walks with strides, a steady hop.
A silent witness, ever near,
To triumphs won, and doubts held dear. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the poem.  ğŸ˜Š  Let me know if you have any other creative requests!
