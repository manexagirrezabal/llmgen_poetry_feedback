 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 7 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming the heart and lighting the night.
It's a gentle touch that sets us free,
A whispered promise of you and me.
In its warmth, we find our peaceful nest,
With love, our hearts are forever blessed.
Together we shine like stars in the sea.
 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome, it was my pleasure to create a little poem for you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
