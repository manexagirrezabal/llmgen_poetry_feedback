Moonlit waves crash on the shore,
A soothing sound that calms once more.
The night air whispers secrets sweet,
As stars twinkle in the midnight treat.

The world is hushed, a peaceful sight,
The moon's soft light shines with gentle might.
A lone seagull cries out in the night,
As if to echo the heart's delight.

In this quiet hour, I find my peace,
A sense of calm that the world can't release.
The ocean's roar and the wind's sigh,
Together lull me into a gentle sky.

And as I stand, the moment feels divine,
A connection made with nature's sweet design.
