A whispered word, a stolen glance so sweet,
Two hearts entwined, their destinies to meet.
Love's gentle touch, a flame that brightly burns,
In shared embraces, where passion gently yearns.

Through fields of flowers, bathed in golden light,
They wander hand in hand, a wondrous sight.
With every beat, their souls begin to soar,
United by love, forevermore.

A symphony of dreams, whispered low and deep,
Two spirits intertwined, their promises to keep.
In love's embrace, they find their perfect place,
A timeless bond, with unwavering grace.
