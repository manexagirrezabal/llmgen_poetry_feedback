 > user: Please create a poem. The poem should contain 14 lines about love. Return only the poem, nothing else.
 > assistant: A spark ignited, a flame took flight,
Two souls entwined in love's gentle light.
Hearts beat as one, a symphony sweet,
A bond unbreakable, hearts truly meet.

Laughter and tears, shared through the years,
Whispered secrets, banishing fears.
Through sunshine bright and storms that rage,
Love's steadfast presence turns every page.

Trust and devotion, a sacred vow,
In each other's arms, they find their "how".
A love that endures, time cannot steal,
Two souls united, forever real.
A masterpiece painted, with passion untold,
A love story whispered, brave, new, and bold. 




 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. ðŸ˜Š  Is there anything else I can help you with?  Perhaps another poem on a different topic?
