 > assistant: A silent curtain falls, the stage grows dark,
The final act begins, a whispered spark.
No more the laughter, tears, or vibrant hues,
Just stillness deep, where life once brightly flew.

A journey ends, a path now left behind,
Where memories linger, etched upon the mind.
A gentle breeze that whispers through the trees,
A rustling leaf, a sigh upon the breeze.

The body sleeps, its weary journey done,
But spirit soars, beneath a silver sun.
In realms unknown, where shadows softly play,
A new adventure dawns, at break of day.

And though we grieve, and tears may freely fall,
Death's gentle touch embraces one and all. 



 > human: Thank you!
 > assistant: You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed the poem.  ðŸ˜Š  Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
